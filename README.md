I like to think that this site [is my "digital garden," not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). I use this term because I use it here to write about some thoughts and ideas I have and want to share with the world. And like a garden, a place where things grow, here is a site where I "seed" my ideas little by little.

There are two kinds of posts here: [articles](/articles) and [Zettelkasten](/zettelkasten). [Articles](/articles) are texts that I put more creative effort into writing, share some ideas, and create some correlation among different topics. [Zettelkasten](/zettelkasten) are notes that I write when I'm doing some research. [Articles](/articles) use these notes to give more credibility to the posts.

## Features

There were many reasons I started this project. Creating a second memory, retain more knowledge, learn design, to name a few. As I was working more and more, I've built more features along the way. I listed them below in the chronological order in which I've created them.

### [Now](/now)

Instead of creating an "about me" page, I've decided to make the [now page](/now). This page shows what I'm focusing on right now at this point in my life. If you want to know more about it, you can check the page [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about).

### [All](/all)

I can find any posts by searching a specific keyword on [all page](/all). This feature comes in handy because sometimes I forget about some topic I've written, but I know there are some notes about it in some posts.

### [Contact](/contact)

It's my [contact page](/contact) that I send to other people to share my social media profiles. It's my business card.

### [Tags](/tags)

I use [tags](/tags) to create connection among posts. It's an essence of the [Zettelkasten](/zettelkasten) method for creating notes. This way I can easily correlate notes, with articles, or book resumes.

### [Drafts](/_drafts)

It contains [unfinished posts](/_drafts). Search engines don't index these posts. Sometimes the post is already finished, but it remains a draft to get a final review after some days.

### [Network](/network)

The main idea of [Zettelkasten](/zettelkasten) is connecting the notes through references and tags. To see the connections between my posts, I've created the [Network](/network). With this feature, I can check my cluster of notes, how they're connected, how they grow over time. I can also discover paths between any topics.

### [Revue](/revue)

I post every week a digest, using [Revue](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/arantespp), of the posts I created in the past seven days. This feature shows the posts I should add to my digest. If you're curious about it, you can check it on the [Revue page](/revue).

### [Questions](/questions)

I ask myself some [questions](/questions) that I don't know how to answer yet, but I register them to remind me to find the answer someday and write notes about them.

### [Flashcard](/flashcard)

It shows posts that were 1, 2, 4, 8... weeks old to remember the topic. I've created this feature to apply the [Spacing Effect](/zettelkasten/spacing-effect-learning), which states that more information is retained in your [long-term memory](/zettelkasten/long-term-memory) by multiple spaced-out study sessions.

## Open Source

I've open-sourced all posts and codebase of this website under [CC BY 4.0 license](/license) on [GitHub](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com). I believe this may encourage others to create a blog too and [create more value for the world](/articles/a-letter-to-my-friend-create).
