I like to think that this site [is my "digital garden," not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). I use this term because I use it here to write about some thoughts and ideas I have and want to share with the world. And like a garden, a place where things grow, here is a site where I "seed" my ideas little by little.

Please, check [arantespp.com](https://arantespp.com) to see what I'm doing there.
