## Background

I hold a degree (2011 - 2015) and an MSc (2016 - 2017) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [EESC - USP](https://eesc.usp.br/). During my undergraduate studies, I was a member of the [Warthog Robotics](https://wr.sc.usp.br/en/home/) team, where I worked on architecting and creating electronics for the robots in the Electronics Division. In my last college year, I was the director of the Control Division, where we were responsible for modeling the robots' dynamics and creating the control algorithms. Also, in my last college year, I was awarded a scientific initiation scholarship on electromagnetism field theory, which was the subject of my [master's thesis](https://teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/18/18155/tde-10112017-093250/en.php).

In 2017, after defending my master's thesis, I decided to leave the academic world to enter the entrepreneurial world. I co-founded [Tri√¢ngulos Tecnologia](https://triangulostecnologia.com), a tech company founded by two other university friends and me. I'm involved in many different areas like recruiting, business ideations, detecting people's real problems to solve, and all the kinds of jobs you need to do when you have a young business. But my leading roles are CTO and managing the company's operations.
