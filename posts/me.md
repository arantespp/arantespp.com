I'm an entrepreneur, engineer, architect, programmer, product developer, writer, sales guy, athlete, and dancer.

I build businesses and products that solve problems for real people.

## Professional

I hold a degree (2011 - 2015) and an MSc (2016 - 2017) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [EESC - USP](https://eesc.usp.br/). During my undergraduate studies, I was a member of the [Warthog Robotics](https://wr.sc.usp.br/en/home/) team, where I worked on architecting and creating electronics for the robots in the Electronics Division. In my last college year, I was the director of the Control Division, where we were responsible for modeling the robots' dynamics and creating the control algorithms. Also, in my last college year, I was awarded a scientific initiation scholarship on electromagnetism field theory, which was the subject of my [master's thesis](https://teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/18/18155/tde-10112017-093250/en.php).

In 2017, after defending my master's thesis, I decided to leave the academic world to enter the entrepreneurial world. I co-founded [Triângulos Tecnologia](https://triangulostecnologia.com), a tech company founded by two other university friends and me. I'm involved in many different areas like recruiting, business ideations, detecting people's real problems to solve, and all the kinds of jobs you need to do when you have a young business. But my leading roles are CTO and managing the company's operations.

## My Life Philosophy

I believe that everything changes. Everything I wrote here may be the truth for me in some moment of my life, but it may not be the truth for me in some other moment of my life. Everything changes depending on our experiences, motivations, and fundamental beliefs that we choose to have. So, I'm not attached to any conclusions but to the fundamentals that lead me to those conclusions.

Independently of the fundamentals I consider essential for me, I strongly agree with the following Socrates' quote: _"It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable."_ For me, the body here doesn't refer only to the physical body but also to our mental, emotional and spiritual body. Once we strengthen these four bodies, we reach a state of [full engagement mode](/books/the-power-of-full-engagement), where we can achieve our full potential. I want to live in this mode.

Among these four bodies, I'm most fascinated by spirituality. I believe that a state of complete presence and consciousness exists, which Jesus and Budha have told us. When we reach it, we don't identify anymore with our egoic mind, and the notion of time that we know doesn't make sense anymore. Only here and now exists—the timeless essence of our being.

## Interests

- **I like women a lot.** I make many decisions in my life based on how I can impress and attract women. They're muses for me. As far as I remember, I only made big changes in my life because of them, like [my dance teacher](/my-story-the-dance-teacher).

- **I love kids.** I like them because they're full of life and energy. But, to be honest, I'll enjoy being with any person with such characteristics.

- **I enjoy walking at the end of the day.** I like to walk alone or with someone at the end of the day to recharge my energy. The place doesn't matter so much since I get some time to disconnect from the world, especially the digital world.
