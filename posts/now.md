# What I'm Doing Now

![This is me. I took this photo at the best concert I've ever seen in my life! The show was performed by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Orquestra-Jazz-Sinf%C3%B4nica-de-S%C3%A3o-Jo%C3%A3o-da-Boa-Vista-1414383348815275/">Orquestra Jazz Sinf√¥nica de S√£o Jo√£o da Boa Vista</a>, and they performed songs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjFf1uNhc48">Another Brick in the Wall version orchestra.</a>](/me.jpg)

Hello there üëã

## TL;DR

I like to say that "I'm an entrepreneur that uses some code to solve problems." The "entrepreneur" part is because I'm [Tri√¢ngulos Tecnologia](https://triangulostecnologia.com) co-founder. The "uses some code" part is because I'm a frontend/serverless developer, typically based in [S√£o Carlos, SP, Brazil](https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/S%C3%A3o+Carlos,+State+of+S%C3%A3o+Paulo/@-22.0184565,-47.9311626,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x94b87726bb9dd181:0xd9d7d71505999bc!8m2!3d-22.0087082!4d-47.8909263).

## Now

I hold a degree (2011 - 2015) and an MSc (2016 - 2017) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [EESC - USP](https://eesc.usp.br/). My graduation and master's main field was electromagnetism, a subject that is very, very interesting for me. But, in 2017, I decided to work with web development. It's easier to build stuff because you need only a computer with an Internet connection. Currently, I'm serverless, focused on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), and [React](https://reactjs.org) frontend developer at [Tri√¢ngulos Tecnologia](https://triangulostecnologia.com), a tech company founded by two other friends from university and me.

I was living in [S√£o Carlos, SP, Brazil](https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/S%C3%A3o+Carlos,+State+of+S%C3%A3o+Paulo/@-22.0184565,-47.9311626,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x94b87726bb9dd181:0xd9d7d71505999bc!8m2!3d-22.0087082!4d-47.8909263), but because of the pandemics, I'm living with my family in the countryside of [S√£o Paulo state](https://www.google.com/maps/place/State+of+S%C3%A3o+Paulo/@-22.5254297,-50.8848527,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x94ce597d462f58ad:0x1e5241e2e17b7c17!8m2!3d-23.5431786!4d-46.6291845). I must confess that I'm enjoying this nomadic life. I'm considering packing my notebook, with my phone routing the Internet, and traveling around several places for some time before coming back to S√£o Carlos üåé. This place flexibility is one of the home office advantages.

Besides spending some time coding, in parallel, I'm cultivating good [five habits for the next five years](/articles/five-habits-for-the-next-five-years) to see how they may improve my life. Writing ‚úçÔ∏è is one of them and was a reason that motivates me to create this blog. So here I'm going to share topics about everything I'm studying.

Two topics that I'm most interested in are [mental models](/tags/mental-models) and [asymmetric opportunities](/zettelkasten/asymmetric-opportunity). Mental models are great because they give you a new perspective on seeing the world, people, and situations. If you have an arsenal of mental models that you can use in any case, then the probability of solving the problem or make better decisions increases. Asymmetric opportunities are great because they give you a new perspective about how you can apply your knowledge in a new way that the results may be greater than the energy cost you spend. Asymmetric opportunities leverage you.

As a side project, I'm creating a project that I call [The Network](/network). We can see it as my second brain. I'm making connections among my posts and tags and displaying them in a network diagram. The most exciting part is that I can choose any two topics and create a relationship between them. The relationship powers the [Zettelkasten](/zettelkasten) method because it may give some insights that I would overlook otherwise.
