# What I'm Doing Now

![This is me. I took this photo at the best concert I've ever seen in my life! The show was performed by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Orquestra-Jazz-Sinf%C3%B4nica-de-S%C3%A3o-Jo%C3%A3o-da-Boa-Vista-1414383348815275/">Orquestra Jazz SinfÃ´nica de SÃ£o JoÃ£o da Boa Vista</a>, and they performed songs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjFf1uNhc48">Another Brick in the Wall version orchestra.</a>](/me.jpg)

Hello there ðŸ‘‹

## TL;DR

I'm an entrepreneur, engineer, architect, scientist, programmer, product developer, writer, sales guy, athlete, and dancer. Maybe I forgot a few.

I build businesses and products that solve problems for real people.

## Now

I'm a product and full-stack web developer at [TriÃ¢ngulos Tecnologia](https://triangulostecnologia.com), a tech company founded by two other friends from university and me. I'm involved in many other areas like recruiting, businesses ideations, detecting real problems of real people, and all that kind of job that you need to do when you have a young business.

I was living in [SÃ£o Carlos, SP, Brazil](https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/S%C3%A3o+Carlos,+State+of+S%C3%A3o+Paulo/@-22.0184565,-47.9311626,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x94b87726bb9dd181:0xd9d7d71505999bc!8m2!3d-22.0087082!4d-47.8909263), but because of the pandemics, I'm living with my family in the countryside of [SÃ£o Paulo state](https://www.google.com/maps/place/State+of+S%C3%A3o+Paulo/@-22.5254297,-50.8848527,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x94ce597d462f58ad:0x1e5241e2e17b7c17!8m2!3d-23.5431786!4d-46.6291845). I'm enjoying this nomadic life. This place's flexibility and being close to my family and friends are some of the home office advantages.

Besides my professional life, I have a personal project of cultivating good [five habits for the next five years](/articles/five-habits-for-the-next-five-years) to see how they may improve my life. Writing is one of them and it was a reason that motivates me to create this blog and share everything I'm learning.

Two topics that I'm most excited about are [mental models](/tags/mental-models) and [asymmetric opportunities](/zettelkasten/asymmetric-opportunity). Mental models are great because they give you a new perspective on seeing the world, people, and situations. If you have an arsenal of mental models that you can use in any case, then the probability of solving problems or making better decisions increases immensely. Asymmetric opportunities are fantastic because they give you a new perspective about how you create and spot opportunities whose upsides are far greater than the downsides. Asymmetric opportunities leverage your time and energy.

As a side project, I'm creating a project that I call [The Network](/network). We can see it as my second brain. I'm making connections among my posts and tags and displaying them in a network diagram. The most interesting part is that I can choose any two topics and create a relationship between them. The relationship powers the [Zettelkasten](/zettelkasten) method because it may give some insights that I would overlook otherwise.
