# What I'm doing now

![My current best photo](/me.jpg 'My current best photo')

Hello there 👋

## TL;DR

I like to say that "I'm an entrepreneur that sometimes uses some coding to solve problems". The "entrepreneur" part is due to the fact that I'm [Triângulos Tecnologia](https://triangulostecnologia.com) co-founder. The "uses some code" part is because I'm a frontend/serverless developer, normally based in [São Carlos, SP, Brazil](https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/S%C3%A3o+Carlos,+State+of+S%C3%A3o+Paulo/@-22.0184565,-47.9311626,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x94b87726bb9dd181:0xd9d7d71505999bc!8m2!3d-22.0087082!4d-47.8909263).

## Now

I hold a degree (2011 - 2015) and a MSc (2016 - 2017) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [EESC - USP](https://eesc.usp.br/). My graduation and master studies were focused on electromagnetism, a subject that is very very interesting for me. But, in 2017, I decided to work with web development. It's easier to build stuff because you need only a computer with Internet. Currently, I'm a serverless, focused on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), and [React](https://reactjs.org) frontend developer at [Triângulos Tecnologia](https://triangulostecnologia.com), a tech company founded by me and two other friends from university.

I'm normally based in [São Carlos, SP, Brazil](https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/S%C3%A3o+Carlos,+State+of+S%C3%A3o+Paulo/@-22.0184565,-47.9311626,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x94b87726bb9dd181:0xd9d7d71505999bc!8m2!3d-22.0087082!4d-47.8909263), but because of the pandemics, I'm living with my family in the countryside of [São Paulo state](https://www.google.com/maps/place/State+of+S%C3%A3o+Paulo/@-22.5254297,-50.8848527,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x94ce597d462f58ad:0x1e5241e2e17b7c17!8m2!3d-23.5431786!4d-46.6291845). I must confess that I'm enjoying this nomadic life. I'm really considering packing my notebook, with my phone routing the Internet, and traveling around several places for some time before coming back to São Carlos 🌎. This is one of home office advantages.

Besides spending a big amount of time coding, in parallel, I'm cultivating good [five habits for the next five years](/articles/five-habits-for-the-next-five-years) to see how they may improve my life. Writing ✍️ is one of them and was a reason that motivates me to create this blog. Here I'm going to share topics about anything and tech tutorial posts I'll write on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/arantespp).

One of my hobbies is studying music, but not playing instruments, rather coding. I love electronic music, love coding and I've found [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/), which is a code-based music creation and performance tool. I'm still learning, but I'm already appreciating this tool. By the way, the photo at the beginning of the page was taken at a concert I've watched. It was the best presentation I've ever seen in my life! The concert was performed by [Orquestra Jazz Sinfônica de São João da Boa Vista](https://www.facebook.com/Orquestra-Jazz-Sinf%C3%B4nica-de-S%C3%A3o-Jo%C3%A3o-da-Boa-Vista-1414383348815275/) and they performed songs like [Another Brick in the Wall version orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjFf1uNhc48).
