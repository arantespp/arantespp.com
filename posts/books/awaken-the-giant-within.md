## Notes

### Chapter 2 - Decisions: The Way of Power

This chapter talks about decisions. If you want to change your life, you need to take action. But what does precede the actions? **Decisions**. Everything in your life is the result of actions you took ten years ago and the decisions you made, or don't, choose to take those actions.

You shape your life by the decisions you've taken, not by the circumstances you had chosen at those moments. Some genetics, familiar, environmental, and relationship circumstances may help you, but they are less effective than the decisions.

Be interested is different from being committed. Be interested shows a preference for something. Be committed means that you've decided to achieve some goal or change your life. You truly decide you'll be able to do anything you want.

Some people don't achieve outstanding results because their decisions are like preferences, "I'd like to stop smoking." A genuine decision means cutting any possibility except the goal you want to achieve. For this reason, it is essential to have a clear vision of what you want.

The better way to make better decisions is to make as many decisions as possible and learn with the results. You don't need to have a fear of wrong decisions because it's because of them that you'll learn and improve your acknowledgment.

Three decisions that you take in every moment of your life that shape your destiny:

1. Your decisions about what to focus on.
1. Your decisions about what things mean to you.
1. Your decisions about what you must do to achieve the results that you want.

Your brain has an internal system to make decisions. It's an invisible force that drives your thoughts, actions, and feelings. This system has five elements:

1. Your fundamental convictions and rules.
1. Your values.
1. Your references.
1. Usual questions that you ask yourself.
1. Emotional states that you experience every moment.

Any change to any element above can make a meaningful change in your life. However, you need to keep this system consistent with your desires and not by its past conditioning.

[Tony](/zettel/tony-robbins) says about the four steps of the Ultimate Success Formula. He affirms that there are no things that you can't achieve if you follow these steps:

1. Decide what you want.
1. You're willing to take massive action.
1. Observe what is working or not.
1. Keep changing your focus until you achieve what you want.
