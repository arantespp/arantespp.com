## TL;DR

### Startups and established companies management need to be different

Startups are different from established companies. After all, they can't predict their future because they have no past, don't know which approaches are best for finding customers, don't know what their customers want, and don't have a sustainable business.

To find out what could work, startups must create flexible plans. Fixed plans only work for established companies that have been around long enough in the market.

### The main goal of a startup is to find a sustainable business model

The one goal is to find a sustainable business model that works today and can work in the future. In practice, this means finding out which products your potential customers want and how to make money from them.

### Use validated learning to find the sustainable business model

You don't need to come up with a great plan from the start. Instead, it requires constant learning through a scientific approach, also known as validated learning. To begin with the process, you must:

1. Come up with hypotheses about whether a given market will want a specific product.
1. Test your fundamental hypotheses. Only if the customers validate that the startup can know it's on the right track toward finding a sustainable business model. The most reliable way to tell whether people will buy our product is to offer it and analyze how they respond.

### Test your value and growth hypotheses

A founder believes in the product's future success she wants to create, even though there's no proof yet. Therefore, every founder should formulate and test two assumptions:

1. The value hypothesis assumes that a product will deliver value to its customers.
1. The growth hypothesis states that the product will find a bit market later.

The assumptions above must be tested as soon as possible and only validated that it's worth investing the time and effort in developing the product.

### Develop an MVP to test your idea in the market

You should find out as quickly as possible whether there is any demand for your product. The quickest and easiest way to get real-world customer feedback is to create a minimal version of the product. This minimal viable product (MVP) should be simple and contain just what is needed to give the customers a realistic experience of how your product would be.

Every startup should first find out whether there's an actual demand for their product before building.

### Build, measure, learn

The cycle build-measure-learn (BML) facilitates learning about your product. You use this cycle to show your product to your customers, gather their feedback, and then learn from it.

First, you build a simple version of your product. Second, you take this product to its actual market and gather customer feedback. Finally, use what you learned in one cycle to conceptualize and build a new and optimized product, which brings you into the next BML cycle. You repeat this process until you find a sustainable business model.

It's essential to be fast in the BML loop. The more loops you can go through, the more likely you will find the business model.
