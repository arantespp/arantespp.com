## TL;DR

### Startups and established companies management need to be different

Startups are different from established companies. After all, they can't predict their future because they have no past, don't know which approaches are best for finding customers, don't know what their customers want, and don't have a sustainable business.

To find out what could work, startups must create flexible plans. Fixed plans only work for established companies that have been around long enough in the market.

### The main goal of a startup is to find a sustainable business model

The one goal is to find a sustainable business model that works today and can work in the future. In practice, this means finding out which products your potential customers want and how to make money from them.

### Use validated learning to find the sustainable business model

You don't need to come up with a great plan from the start. Instead, it requires constant learning through a scientific approach, also known as validated learning. To begin with the process, you must:

1. Come up with hypotheses about whether a given market will want a specific product.
1. Test your fundamental hypotheses. Only if the customers validate that the startup can know it's on the right track toward finding a sustainable business model. The most reliable way to tell whether people will buy our product is to offer it and analyze how they respond.

### Test your value and growth hypotheses

A founder believes in the product's future success she wants to create, even though there's no proof yet. Therefore, every founder should formulate and test two assumptions:

1. The value hypothesis assumes that a product will deliver value to its customers.
1. The growth hypothesis states that the product will find a bit market later.

The assumptions above must be tested as soon as possible and only validated that it's worth investing the time and effort in developing the product.

### Develop an MVP to test your idea in the market

You should find out as quickly as possible whether there is any demand for your product. The quickest and easiest way to get real-world customer feedback is to create a minimal version of the product. This minimal viable product (MVP) should be simple and contain just what is needed to give the customers a realistic experience of how your product would be.

Every startup should first find out whether there's an actual demand for their product before building.

### Build, measure, and learn

The cycle build-measure-learn (BML) facilitates learning about your product. You use this cycle to show your product to your customers, gather their feedback, and then learn from it.

First, you build a simple version of your product. Second, you take this product to its actual market and gather customer feedback. Finally, use what you learned in one cycle to conceptualize and build a new and optimized product, which brings you into the next BML cycle. You repeat this process until you find a sustainable business model.

It's essential to be fast in the BML loop. The more loops you can go through, the more likely you will find the business model.

### You usually have to pivot to find the suitable business model

You should ask yourself how to change your product to improve it and create more value for your customers. If you don't do this, you can become a land of living dead that can't take a hint and will keep working hard to sell a product that the market doesn't want.

A pivot can take many shapes: changing your primary sales channel, adding a new customer segment, and redefining your product's core value. The main characteristic is that the core assumptions have changed, and you need to test the new hypotheses again.

### Every startup should initially focus on one engine of growth

A fundamental part of any business model is its growth engine to ensure the company doesn't stagnate. There are three different kinds of growth engines:

1. The sticky engine works by retaining existing customers who already generate a constant stream of revenue. The focus is to make the current customers use the product even more often by offering excellent service.

1. The viral engine works by getting existing customers to take care of the company's marketing. The current customers engage with your product and tell about your product to others by word-of-mouth. You should make it easy for customers to engage in this kind of viral marketing.

1. The paid engine works by investing in marketing, as online advertising. This engine is only sustainable if the existing customers bring in enough revenues to keep the balance positive.

It's often wise to focus on only one of them at first to pick up speed as quickly as possible.

### Vanity metrics are often flattering but misleading

To find a sustainable business model, you should get directions by examining the right metrics. To gauge whether you've made any progress toward your long-term goals, you need to explore the data you've gathered along the way.

Unfortunately, many startups rely on vanity metrics, which is the equivalent of a slimming mirror. These are useless or harmful metrics that make a company look good but don't help bring it closer to its goal.

For instance, it may be flattering to get a lot of media attention on Facebook, but it doesn't necessarily mean that paying customers are using your product.

### Every startup has to define and analyze its core metrics properly

Establishing the right metrics to track and continuously evaluate them is crucial for any startup. You can only know you're on the way towards your sustainable business model by analyzing your metrics.

The right core metrics often are numbers of paying customers, average session length per customer, and the number of recommendations generated by customers. Each startup has to find the right metrics to give it direction and a realistic view of its progress. Only if the metric is improving are you progressing; otherwise, you're stagnating.
