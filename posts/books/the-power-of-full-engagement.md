## TL;DR

## Part One - The Dynamics of Full Engagement

### One - Fully Engaged: Energy, Not Time, Is Our Most Precious Resource

Most people are living lives in which work never ends. We use words like obsessed, crazed and overwhelmend to characterize our everyday lives, not to describe insanity. We survive on too little sleep, wolf down fast foods on the run, fuel up with coffee and cool down with alcohol and sleeping pills. We constantly feel exhausted.

> Energy, not time, is the fundamental currency of high performace.

Everything we do, we need energy. Without the right quantity, quality, focus and force of energy, we're compromised in any activity we undertake. Every thoughts, behaviors, and emotions has an energy consequence, for better or worse. **The ultimate measure of our lives is how much energy we invest in the time that we have**.

> Performance, health and happiness are grounded in the skillful management of energy.

The number of hours in a day is fixed, but the quantity and the quality of energy during our days isn't. Our energy not only allow us to perform better, but also affects everyone around us. What would happen if you bring more positive energy and passion to your family, friends, and coworkers? How would it affect their relationships with one another? The skillful management of energy, individually and organizationally, makes possible some that we call **full engagement.**
