## Chapter 11 - The Mystery of Sex Transmutation

The emotion of sex has three constructive potentialities:

1. The perpetuation of humankind.
1. The maintenance of health.
1. The transformation of mediocrity into genius through transmutation.

Sex transmutation means switching the mind from thoughts of physical expression to thoughts of some other nature. Sex desire is the most powerful of human desires. When driven by this desire, one develops keenness of imagination, courage, willpower, persistence, and creative ability unknown to them.

### The Ten Mind Stimuli

The stimuli to which the mind responds most freely are:

1. The desire for sex expression (the strongest)
2. Love
3. The desire for fame, power, or money.
4. Music
5. Friendship
6. A [Master Mind](/z/mastermind)
7. Mutual suffering
8. Auto-suggestion
9. Fear
10. Narcotics and alcohol.

The author defines genius as a "person who has discovered how to increase the vibrations of thoughts to the point where he can freely communicate with sources of knowledge not available through the ordinary rate of vibration of thought." The mind vibrates at a higher frequency due to some form of stimuli. Some questions may arise:

> How may one communicate with sources of knowledge which are not available through the ordinary rate of vibration of thought? What are these sources, and exactly how may they be reached?

### Genius is developed through the Sixth Sense

The sixth sense is **creative imagination**â€”the direct link between the finite mind of man and Infinite Intelligence. It functions best when the mind vibrates at an exceedingly high rate (higher than the normal thought). The ten mind stimulants have the effect of lifting the individual far above the horizon of ordinary ideas.

Many people don't reach the creative imagination. They use only the synthetic or reasoning faculty, which are often faulty because one's accumulated experience primarily guides it. Not all knowledge accumulated by experience is accurate. Genius makes use of both the synthetic and the creative faculties of imagination.

The importance of the urge sex is because it's the most outstanding and most potent mind stimuli. When harnessed and transmuted, this driving force can lift men into a higher sphere of thought. Sex energy is the creative energy of all genii. However, the mere possession of this energy isn't sufficient to produce genius. One must transmute the energy from the desire for physical contact into some other form of desire and action.

Generally, the procedure to achieve a higher state of thoughts and active, creative imagination is:

1. Stimulate the mind so that it vibrates on a higher-than-average plane.
2. Concentrate upon the known factors of the problem and create a perfect picture of unknown factors in mind. Hold the picture in mind until it has been taken over by the subconscious mind, then relaxes by clearing the mind of all thoughts and waits for the answer to flash.

When ideas or concepts flash into one's mind, they come from or more of the following sources:

1. Infinite Intelligence.
2. One's subconscious mind.
3. From the mind of another person who has just released the thought.
4. From his subconscious storehouse.
