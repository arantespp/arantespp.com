## TL;DR

Napoleon Hill says that there is a secret that makes everyone who uses it rich. Everyone, if prepared, will discover the secret through the book, in a specific chapter, example, or idea.

## Chapter 1 - Introduction

In this chapter, Napoleon talks about thoughts and desires. When someone desires a thing so deeply and has the determination to keep going, she is sure to win. But, before success, he is sure to meet with temporary defeat or failure, in which the majority quit—the easiest way. More than five hundred successful men told their most tremendous success came just one step beyond the point where defeat had overtaken them.

### Illustrating the secret

When Ford decided to produce his famous V-8 motor, he chose to build an engine with the entire eight cylinders cast in one block. However, the engineers responsible for designing it said that it was impossible.

"Produce it anyway," Ford said. "Go ahead and stay on the job until you succeed no matter how much time is required."

The engineers went ahead. Six months went by, another six months passed, and nothing happened. At the end of the year, Ford checked with his engineers, and they informed him they couldn't find a solution.

"Go ahead," said Ford, "I want it, and I'll have it."

They went ahead, and then they discovered the V-8 motor. So the Ford **determination** had won once more.

Napoleon says that this story contains the sum and substance of the secret of the Ford millions. Could you deduce it?

### We have the power to control our thoughts

We're the masters of our Fate, the Captains of our souls because we have the power to control our thoughts. Our brains become magnetized with the dominating thoughts in our minds. These magnets attract to us the forces, the people, the circumstances of life which resonate with the nature of our dominating thoughts.

Wherever we want for us, we have to magnetize our minds with an intense **desire** for what we want.

## Chapter 7 - Organized Planning

(The Sixth Step to Riches)

## Chapter 11 - The Mystery of Sex Transmutation

The emotion of sex has three constructive potentialities:

1. The perpetuation of humankind.
1. The maintenance of health.
1. The transformation of mediocrity into genius through transmutation.

Sex transmutation means switching the mind from thoughts of physical expression to thoughts of some other nature. Sex desire is the most powerful of human desires. When driven by this desire, one develops keenness of imagination, courage, willpower, persistence, and creative ability unknown to them.

### The Ten Mind Stimuli

The stimuli to which the mind responds most freely are:

1. The desire for sex expression (the strongest)
2. Love
3. The desire for fame, power, or money.
4. Music
5. Friendship
6. A [Master Mind](/zettel/mastermind)
7. Mutual suffering
8. Auto-suggestion
9. Fear
10. Narcotics and alcohol.

The author defines genius as a "person who has discovered how to increase the vibrations of thoughts to the point where he can freely communicate with sources of knowledge not available through the ordinary rate of vibration of thought." The mind vibrates at a higher frequency due to some form of stimuli. Some questions may arise:

> How may one communicate with sources of knowledge which are not available through the ordinary rate of vibration of thought? What are these sources, and exactly how may they be reached?

### Genius is developed through the Sixth Sense

The sixth sense is **creative imagination**—the direct link between the finite mind of man and Infinite Intelligence. It functions best when the mind vibrates at an exceedingly high rate (higher than the normal thought). The ten mind stimulants have the effect of lifting the individual far above the horizon of ordinary ideas.

Many people don't reach the creative imagination. They use only the synthetic or reasoning faculty, which are often faulty because one's accumulated experience primarily guides it. Not all knowledge accumulated by experience is accurate. Genius makes use of both the synthetic and the creative faculties of imagination.

The importance of the urge sex is because it's the most outstanding and most potent mind stimuli. This driving force can lift men into a higher sphere of thought when harnessed and transmuted. Sex energy is the creative energy of all genii. However, the mere possession of this energy isn't sufficient to produce genius. One must transmute the energy from the desire for physical contact into some other form of desire and action.

Generally, the procedure to achieve a higher state of thoughts and active, creative imagination is:

1. Stimulate the mind so that it vibrates on a higher-than-average plane.
2. Concentrate upon the known factors of the problem and create a perfect picture of unknown factors in mind. Hold the picture in mind until it has been taken over by the subconscious mind, then relaxes by clearing the mind of all thoughts and waits for the answer to flash.

When ideas or concepts flash into one's mind, they come from or more of the following sources:

1. Infinite Intelligence.
2. One's subconscious mind.
3. From the mind of another person who has just released the thought.
4. From his subconscious storehouse.
