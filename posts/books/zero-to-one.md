## TL;DR

- Startups need a solid foundation composed of the right people, culture, and balanced owner interests to survive in the long run.
  - The first days of a startup are crucial so that every person on the team plays an important role, so the right people are the first key component.
  - The second factor of a strong foundation is culture. It's important to instill a strong culture in their teams because it helps everyone work effectively together.
  - The third key factor is ensuring a balance among the different interests of the various owners and stakeholders. After all, founds and investors may have other interests that shouldn't affect the whole company.
