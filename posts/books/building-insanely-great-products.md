## Chapter Two: Research And Development Expenditures Worldwide

Product failures tend to fail into six general areas, also the six keys to product success (SPICES):

- [Strategy](#strategy)
- [Process](#process)
- [Information](#information)
- [Customers](#customers)
- [Employees](#employess)
- [Systems and Tools](#systems-and-tools)

Product success is based on building a successful company, which understands customers, innovation, a market strategy for the product, and implementation. Implementation is the hard part because it involves marketing, sales, service, support, and operations.

### Strategy

Every product should have a strategy that should be mostly done before development begins. Unfortunately, many people mistake just identifying a few parts of the strategy and then jumping into development. Only later, when the product does not sell, does the organization goes back and try to figure out the plan.

A strategy or a plan for our product for a specific market or markets is the **product market strategy,** whose checklist is:

- Values, Vision/Mission Statement
- Decision Making: DACI or RACI Chart
- Schedule with responsibilities

#### "Do"

Start with the observation of behavior in the search for a problem to solve. Any other way, including technology, will not necessarily help build insanely great products. Instead, you need to find 15 unmet needs that your product will fulfill, and [brainstorming](/zettel/brainstorming) isn't the way to do it.

The question "What do you need?" is the wrong question to ask your potential customers when doing marker research. Instead, the question you should do is, "What do you do?" Better yet, you should act like a social anthropologist and go out to discover what they do first.

Observe your customers and prospective customers and try to find answers to these questions:

- What do you do?
- How do you do it?
- Why do you do it?
- Where do you do it?
- When do you do it?
- What's standing in your way?

Then you can translate those "do's" into wants and need and create real solutions that people will buy, not just a technology that may or may not solve a problem.

If you are B2C, use [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](/zettel/maslow-s-hierarchy-of-needs); if you're B2B, use Porter's Value Chain to start figuring out what your customer does.

#### Innovation

Which innovation tools should one use? Which ones work?

- [Design Thinking](/zettel/design-thinking)
- User Experience (UX) and the User Interface (UI)
- [Agile](/zettel/agile)
- Documentation
- Support

#### Problem Scenarios, Use Cases, and Outcomes

Problem Scenarios, Use Cases, and Outcomes are tools in helping define what a product is going to do. You can generate them after surveys with potential customers.

- **Problem Scenarios** are detailed descriptions of a customer problem. It's a story and perhaps followed by requirements of what the customers need.
- **Use cases** describe how the customers will use the product, like a list of actions of event steps.
- **Outcomes** are what customers expect to get out of the product.

These tools rest on the foundation of finding out what the customer wants to "do." They help the team move from the "problem" space to the "solution" space (engineering). _It's like algebra linear in that you use a transformation matrix to move from a domain to another._

#### Opportunity and Risks

Each product has a set of circumstances that makes it possible to succeed if well thought out. Usually, each product has a market window such that if it arrives too soon or too late, it might fail in the marketplace. As part of the opportunity planning, one must identify the circumstances that enable the product to succeed. As part of the risk planning, one should recognize the potential risks and what actions can reduce these risks.

#### Prioritization

#### Value Propositions

#### Personas

#### Market/Competitive Research and Analysis

The four primary market research methods for a product are observation, interviews, surveys, and analytics. Secondary market research is information from studies done by other organizations. Secondary research may or not be accurate for your product, but they're cheap.

##### Observation

Select candidates that you plan to observe based upon your target criteria. If you plan to go after people who are likely to have a healthier life, pick those who regularly go to the gym.

##### Interviews

Your interview questions should focus on the what, how, when, where, who, blocking questions, importance, and satisfaction level with their current solution. It would help if you also asked for demographic, firmographic, and ethnographic information so you can organize and classify. Be careful not to mix questions for buyers, users, and influencers.

##### Surveys

Survey with a representative sample of your target market segments. Then, use the responses and results from the interviews to refine your questions.

##### Analytics

Use analytics to discover and communicate meaningful patterns in data. Additionally, you can research keywords used in web searches to identify people's words to find solutions to their problems.

#### Market Status and Adoption

There are [five categories of innovation adopters](/zettel/diffusion-of-innovations-adopter-categories): innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. Decide early on which segment you plan to target and over the lifecycle of your product.

#### Technology Insights

Technology is only relevant if it disrupts by delivering dramatic improvements in desired outcomes, such as making them faster, cheaper, or better. The disruption is only profitable if the market wants dramatic improvements. If the market expects it, you can decide upon your market entry point and introduce your product at the appropriate window of opportunity. Next, you use your technology to defend against competition.

#### Competitive Research

When you do your market environment analysis, you must look at both the product vs. product and the company vs. company. Unfortunately, many forgot to do the company vs. company comparison. For example, suppose you're planning on entering a new market and don't do a competitive analysis. In that case, you may find out later that your competitor has some monopoly on the distribution channel.

You can do competitive analysis as part of the planning process and around the projected launch time. First, you forecast where you think your competitors' products and companies will be at your product's expected launch time. Secondly, make the comparison again then to check if your competitors have a new version, changed their price, run a promotion, adds distribution, for a new partnership, and so on. These changes alter the environment at launch time, and you need to take those changes into account.

Do the products' research regarding what problems they solve, not just the features they have.

##### Company vs. Company Comparison

When you do your company vs. company competitive comparison and analysis, do it in SPICES.

1. What is their Strategy?
1. What is their Process?
1. What Information do they have?
1. Who are their Customers, and are they satisfied?
1. How good and how well trained are their Employees?
1. What Systems and tools are they using?

#### Product Positioning

Product positioning is one of the most important things that you can do for your product. It consists in positioning your product against the competitors, thus clearly establishing the different positions each product takes. It's the unique and lasting position you'd like to develop in the customer's mind.

Product positioning precedes product branding, which is the "promise" of the product based on positioning. Branding is the look, feel, and experience of the product, all combined into one.

Product positioning placed and in agreement throughout your organization enables consistency across all communications during the product launch and the sustaining marketing. Consistency in all channels is key to product success. On the other hand, if you don't have consistency, the prospective customer will get confused, and perhaps they won't buy your product.

The first step in positioning is to create a radar chart, as depicted below. To do so, you'll have to decide on what to use for the axes, which should be what are most valuable to your customers. Finally, you should create the plot based on your actual research about what customers "do."

![Positioning Radar Chart](/images/originals/product-positioning.png)

You can also define the position using position statements. You can find more about the theory on [Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind](https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B006B7LQ90/) by Al Ries and Jack Trout. For instance, a positioning statement should contain:

- Targeted persona;
- Product/company name;
- Characterization or category of use;
- Benefits;
- Differentiator.

#### Market Segment, Target Market and Size

A market segment is an addressable market with common needs and characteristics that you can monetize with your product. It can be quite dynamic and changing, but by using big data, you may be able to reach and track it.

TODO

#### Total Available Market

The total available or addressable market (TAM) is a subject of the market segments, which means a market or segment that you can reach through your marketing and distribution channels. If you can't reach a part of a market because of governmental laws, for example, you should not consider that part in your TAM.

In the example of the figure below, we have:

- Overall semiconductor market of \$125 billion.
- In a market segment under that, it is semiconductor equipment, which is $28 billion.
- Within the equipment market, there are specific kinds of equipment, which is $12.7 billion.
- Then, within that market segment, it is the masking market, which is $2 billion.

![The total available market of the masking market.](/images/originals/total-available-market.png)

### Process

You need a repeatable, mature and optimized product lifecycle framework with a process. Without such a framework, you'll enhance your chances of failure and may develop a culture of blame within your organization. A product lifecycle framework will enhance the chances of success, reduce duplication of effort, and nearly eliminate rushing a product to market before you're ready.

The author mentions The Spice Catalyst product lifecycle framework, which focus on all stages

Questions to assess your process:

1. What is your role?
2. Who owns the overall responsibility for the product's success?
3. What is your process for gathering and prioritizing requirements and feature requests?
4. What deliverables do they own or greatly contribute to?
5. What is working best?
6. What is missing?
7. What are your biggest challenges?
8. Where are the biggest bottlenecks? What slows you down most?
9. What changes would you make?
10. Are there things that you have done or seen other companies that worked better?
11. What tools and software do you use today?
    a. What is good about them?
    b. What could be improved?
12. Specifically, what information about your customers and your products is available to your product managers and product marketing that helps them do their job?
    a. What additional information do they need?
13. How do you go about assessing the competency of your product managers and product marketing managers?
14. In your words, what is the vision of your company?
15. What are the values of the company?
16. Please, describe the company's culture.
