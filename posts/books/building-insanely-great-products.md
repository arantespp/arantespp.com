#### What do people do?

Start with the observation of behavior in the search for a problem to solve. Any other way, including technology, will not necessarily help build insanely great products. Instead, you need to find 15 unmet needs that your product will fulfill, and [brainstorming](/z/brainstorming) isn't the way to do it.

The question "What do you need?" is the wrong question to ask your potential customers when doing marker research. Instead, the question you should do is, "What do you do?" Better yet, you should act like a social anthropologist and go out to discover what they do first.

Observe your customers and prospective customers and try to find answers to these questions:

- What do you do?
- How do you do it?
- Why do you do it?
- Where do you do it?
- When do you do it?
- What's standing in your way?
