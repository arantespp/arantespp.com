## Chapter Two: Research And Development Expenditures Worldwide

SPICES

### Strategy

Every product should have a strategy that should be mostly done before development begins. Unfortunately, many people mistake just identifying a few parts of the strategy and then jumping into development. Only later, when the product does not sell, does the organization goes back and try to figure out the plan.

A strategy or a plan for our product for a specific market or markets is the **product market strategy,** whose checklist is:

- Values, Vision/Mission Statement
- Decision Making: DACI or RACI Chart
- Schedule with responsibilities
- [Discover "Do"](#discover-do)
- Innovation
- Problem Scenarios Use Cases and Outcomes
- Opportunity and Risks
- Prioritization
- Value Propositions
- Personas
- Technology Insights
- Market Size, Segments, and Target Market
- Total Available Market
- Competitive Environment
- Pricing Strategy
- Metrics

#### Discover "Do"

Start with the observation of behavior in the search for a problem to solve. Any other way, including technology, will not necessarily help build insanely great products. Instead, you need to find 15 unmet needs that your product will fulfill, and [brainstorming](/z/brainstorming) isn't the way to do it.

The question "What do you need?" is the wrong question to ask your potential customers when doing marker research. Instead, the question you should do is, "What do you do?" Better yet, you should act like a social anthropologist and go out to discover what they do first.

Observe your customers and prospective customers and try to find answers to these questions:

- What do you do?
- How do you do it?
- Why do you do it?
- Where do you do it?
- When do you do it?
- What's standing in your way?

Then you can translate those "do's" into wants and need and create real solutions that people will buy, not just a technology that may or may not solve a problem.
