## TL;DR

- Blitzscaling means that a business grows rapidly, but also proportional in all departments, and therefore sustainable.
- Blitzscaling strategy embraces significant risks and uncertainty.
- This strategy prioritizes speed over efficiency.
- Every blitzscaling company should seek to maximize these four growth factors:

  - Market size. For a company to blitzscale, its market needs to be sizable.
  - High gross margins. They give companies more than money. They also make it easier to fund expansion, operations improvements and attract more capital.
  - Distribution. You need to have a good distribution of your product and services to achieve a massive scale.
- [Product/market fit](/product-market-fit) and operational scalability are crucial to achieving the speed of blitzscaling.
- Companies need management strategy and long-term growth plan.
  - Management strategy helps the company define the departments, management philosophy, organization, and company culture.
