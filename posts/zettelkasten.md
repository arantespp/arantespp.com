# What is Zettelkasten?

Zettelkasten is a method in which you write down your thoughts in notes, tag them, and connect them over time. The sociologist [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann) used this method, which helped him be highly prolific in his field. During his 40 years of research, he published more than 70 books and over 400 scholarly articles.

I enjoy this method, and I use it when I'm learning some topic or trying to create correlations among topics. If you want to know more about it, I recommend [this post](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125) that explains the history, advantages, and how to create a Zettelkasten for you. I've also written [some notes](/zettelkasten/zettelkasten) about this method.

My notes usually have four main parts:

- Notes: they're my notes about the topic.
- Questions: they're questions I made while studying the subject to perform a [metacognitive reading](/zettelkasten/reading-metacognitively).
- References: these are references that I consulted to write the notes.
- Backlinks: links to other notes that refer to the current page.
