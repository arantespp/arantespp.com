# Welcome to my Digital Garden

I like to think that this site [is my "digital garden," not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). I use this term because I use it here to write about some thoughts and ideas I have and want to share with the world. And like a garden, a place where things grow, here is a site where I "seed" my ideas little by little.

## Features

There were many reasons I started this project. Creating a second memory, retain more knowledge, learn design, to name a few. As I was working more and more, I've built more features along the way.
