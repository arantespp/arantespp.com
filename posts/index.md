# Pedro's Blog

Hello, my name is Pedro. Welcome to my blog! I consider this blog my digital garden and a [tool](/features) I use for some personal tasks, specially my learning process, for which I'm using the [Zettelkasten](/zettelkasten) method. This method is the foundation of this blog and the methodology that I choose to organize my studies through notes, tags, and the connections between them. I'm also using my blog to refine my writing skills and, consequently, to think clearer, that is one of my ultimate personal goals.

Sharing knowledge is powerful. Instead of reading a book or an article and keeping the knowledge only with me, I leverage my studying hours by sharing my conclusions and synthesis with the world. Doing this also increases my chances of connecting with amazing people, sharing thoughts and experiences, and having good talks and moments.
