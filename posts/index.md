# Pedro's Blog

Hello, my name is Pedro. Welcome to my blog!

I consider this blog my digital garden and a [tool](/features) I use for some personal tasks, especially my learning process, for which I'm using the [Zettelkasten](/zettelkasten) method. This method is the foundation of this blog and the methodology I choose to organize my studies through notes, tags, and the connections between them. I'm also using my blog to refine my writing skills and, consequently, to think clearerâ€”one of my ultimate personal goals.

Sharing knowledge is powerful. Instead of reading a book or an article and keeping the knowledge only with me, I leverage the studying hours by posting my conclusions and synthesis with the world. Doing this can help many people and increases my chances of connecting, sharing experiences, and having good moments with incredible people.
