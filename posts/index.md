# Pedro's Blog

Hello, my name is Pedro. Welcome to my blog! I consider this blog my digital garden and a [tool](/features) I use to learn better. I improved my learning process with the [Zettelkasten](/zettelkasten), a method to organize my studies notes and ideas, which is the blog's foundation. I'm also using it to improve my writing skills and, consequently, to think clearerâ€”one of my ultimate goals.

Sharing knowledge is powerful. Instead of reading a book or an article and keeping the knowledge only with me, I leverage my studying hours by sharing my conclusions and synthesis with the world. Doing this also increases my chances of connecting with amazing people, sharing thoughts and experiences, and having good talks and moments.
