- I. talked to me about my blog because he also wants to start using the Zettelkasten method.

  - He also told me that my blog could be a SaaS.

- I worked the whole day on carlin, especially integrating Slack with the report handler.

- We sent a gift to R. as Triângulos.

- I went with D. to Tucano's to each a snack. The first idea was to take açaí, but it was cold, and I was hungry. It was fun. We talked about the artist and model business and its strategy to persuade people.
  - He told me that I saw people in their eyes and that this is very uncommon. I said that I enjoy meeting people, and I do this because I'm very interested in their stories.
