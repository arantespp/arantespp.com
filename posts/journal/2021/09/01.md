- I need 2 hours to complete my MHS: brush my teeth, meditation, breakfast, read a blink or an article, and do flexibility exercises.

- I talked with R. because he wants to invest in solar energy with us. How can we make money with solar energy? Can we facilitate installations, sell data or use crypto to "transform" the energy?

- I want to work in three market segments: agro, computing, and energy.

- R. created a small issue for me, and I made my one-day PR. First, I worked on improving our UI library by studying Storybook and how to make easy tests.

- I did my workout. Four series with ten burpees each is very hard.
