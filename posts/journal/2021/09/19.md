- I wake earlier, at 6h30, compared with the previous days.

- I read the fascinating mega-thread below. Someday I'll create my mega-thread. Additionally, [Purposeful Stupidity](/z/purposeful-stupidity) was the tweet that most caught my attention.

- I worked the whole day on the Beer Match landing page.

- The Backstage course was about kind of clothes and fashion show. Next week will be the last day.

- When I arrived home, I was without electricity, so I had to wait for a little before continuing the landing page project.

- I went to bed late.
