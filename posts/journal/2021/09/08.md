- I worked at my uncle's house to work from there.

- S. asked my top three personal and business priorities. I answered:
  - Personal:
    - Get the Full Engagement energy management.
    - Build a multidimensional life.
    - Create an impact in the world.
  - Business:
    - Automate my job to retire at my company.
    - Build a SaaS.
    - Create and define our processes and departments.
