- My morning was in a meeting with my partners. We discussed my proposal to work on OPX. I'm interested in working there, but I'd have to give up Triângulos and the three years of my life that I invested there. The main reason I want to continue working on Triângulos is to improve my ability to create businesses.

- I implemented CICD on the Sfl project.
