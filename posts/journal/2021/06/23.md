- I woke up at 6:45.

- I had thoughts about "energy." It's not my beauty and body (external) that may change people, but my energy, smile, humor, power, agency, love, etc., that will impress people.

- I did my 30 minutes meditation.

- For half of my morning work, I studied product development Flow, particularly the economic view.

- Today was more productive.

- A question I asked myself was, **"How can I increase my social capital?"**

- I learned in a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/arantespp/status/1407662796498780162) that we should focus on marketing from the first day of any startup.
