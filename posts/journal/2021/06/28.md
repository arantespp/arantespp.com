- I woke up later today, at 8:00. I think I was starting to be sick, and my body needs a lot of rest. I woke up healthy.

- I woke up is a sad feeling that I don't know the reason for that feeling. I tried a 1-hour meditation, but it wasn't enough to understand such feelings.

- I thought about writing an article telling about the day I talked with Heber for one hour.

- I couldn't keep [Benjamin Franklin's schedule](/zettelkasten/benjamin-franklin-s-schedule).

- I need to learn how to bump a MongoDB using Docker to test a POC.

- I posted some stores singing Razões e Emoções, and I had many text messages in my Instagram inbox.
