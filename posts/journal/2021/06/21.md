- We discussed strategies for charging our clients.

  - Pay as the client uses the resources?
  - Fixed payment with limited resource usage?

- I talked with a friend about the transfer of fantasies between therapist and patient. The therapist should be neutral to doesn't add personal fantasies to patient fantasy.

- I entered the [flow state](/zettelkasten/flow-state-psychology) working on the Instagram Posts Generator project.

  - I created posts about [No B.S. Time Management for Entrepreneurs](/books/no-b-s-time-management-for-entrepreneurs).

- I went to bed at 2:30.
