- It was a freezing dawn today.

- I'm thinking a lot about leverage. How can I increase my impact? **How can I use the Internet to reach more people?**

- I sent a registration on React Conf 2021 to talk about my Instagram Posts Generator.

- My afternoon work was productive. I worked on a new infrastructure of the Edtvg project.

- I decided to answer Instagram in a specific time window. Maybe from 20h30 to 21h?

- I talked with V about nomadic life because he is going to live in SÃ£o Paulo for some time. I'm considering living in a different place for one year.

- I created Journals Summary.
