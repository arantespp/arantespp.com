- I woke up at 6:30.

- I signed a contract with Backstage Models. So let's see what the future brings to me.

- I started my workday with the question _"What good shall I do this day?"_ and finished with _"What good I have done today?"_.

- I worked in a Search component to teach Rayza how she could implement the component.

- I spoke about my path as a software house founder on the Sibelius Discord server. I should talk more about my experience.

- I forgot the requisites we allow founders to join in our [Venture Building](/zettelkasten/startup-studio). The prerequisites:
  - The founder must assume the CEO role.
  - The founder must be a specialist in the field that we'll work.
  - Timing to find the [PMF](/zettelkasten/product-market-fit).
