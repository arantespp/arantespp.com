- I woke up early. The first thing I did was the journal. After, I started to read about ECS clusters with spot fleets.

  - I decided to create a single EC2 instance instead of an ECS cluster because it's easier.

- Simulare landing page had problems with overflow Y.

- **How do I know that what I'm telling myself is an excuse or a justificative?**
