- I decided to create a habit stacking:

  1.  Breakfast.
  2.  Brush my teeth.
  3.  Mobility exercises.
  4.  Meditation.

- **How do I start a mentorship?**

- I scheduled my first mentorship. I'm going to talk with E.

  - I don't know how I can help him yet. Maybe I can show him what I'm doing and help him write an article or create a project on GitHub.

- I confirmed my presence on the Backstage course.
