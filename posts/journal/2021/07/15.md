- On the constant battle with productivity, I decided to start 30/10 Pomodoro again. So I'm going to be softly in the next few days.

- My project to follow [Benjamin Franklin's schedule](/zettelkasten/benjamin-franklin-s-schedule) was unsuccessful because it was tough to wake up early in winter.

  - I'm going to try again when the weather gets warmer.

- 30/10 Pomodoro worked well. I'll keep it for the next few days.

- Worked with Simulare landing page.

- Create pedro@arantespp.com email and integrated it on Gmail.

- We delivered our email service to our first customer.
