- I read about roles in the engineering department. I wrote a note about the [VP of Engineering role](/zettelkasten/vp-of-engineering).

- I talked with S. that we don't have the roles clearly defined at Tri√¢ngulos.

- I need to talk more about my company with others to perceive problems that otherwise I'd overlook.
