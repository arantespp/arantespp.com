- I read about roles in the engineering department. I wrote a note about the [VP of Engineering role](/zettelkasten/vp-of-engineering).

- I talked with S. that we don't have the roles clearly defined at Tri√¢ngulos.

- I need to talk more about my company with others to perceive problems that otherwise I'd overlook.

- I gained some followers after M. tweet about his issue and that I helped him. Do people follow people that help others?

- I felt that I understood better what a company is, mainly its processes, roles, and departments.

- I installed an app called Blinkist, which provides book resumes.
