- I worked on the landing page project.

- I received a lot of likes in a tweet about design and landing pages. So it makes sense to share your landing page monorepo with the community.

- I received feedback from [Ali Abouelatta](https://twitter.com/abouelatta_ali) on Twitter about my blog.

- I met L. in the afternoon. She told me that she'd travel in September to work on her project.

- At night, I pack my bag to travel to Auriflama. I plan to pass one in Auriflama, and another week in Parana√≠ba, before returning to Campinas to take the Backstage course.

- I read [The Power of Full Engagement](/books/the-power-of-full-engagement) on the bus, and I loved the concepts about energy management. So I'm going to read it instead of [Getting Things Done](/books/getting-things-done).
