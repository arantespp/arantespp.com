- I rode a quad with a friend that I haven't seen for a long time. We met in SÃ£o Paulo in 2015, when I lived there to do my internship. It was a fantastic day.

- I talked about relationships with A. and the principles I expected from our partners. For me, we should:
  1.  have a "spiritual" life;
  2.  have complicity;
  3.  look for each other to be the first person to tell something good (I don't know if I wrote this clearly in English.)
