  - Build a multi-dimensional life.
  - Write regularly.
  - Being enthusiastic optimistic is an asymmetric bet.
  - Have a mindset of abundance.

- I start to write [Questions I Ask When I Met People](/articles/questions-i-ask-when-i-met-people).

- I talked with my uncle to help him with his retail company.

- I read about queue on Flow.

- A startup without a CEO takes longer to make decisions.

  - What is the [schilling point](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1160722681441873920?s=21)?

- I read about [product-promise-market fit](https://www.nfx.com/post/new-mindset-product-market-fit/). It's a step to be done before finding product/market fit.

  - I also subscribed to NFX PDFs about Superhuman's Product Frameworks and 10 Places to Find Product-Market Fit.

- I read the book Thinking, Fast and Slow summary on Blinkist. Then, I created a "Projects" note on Google Notes with some concepts that I need to study before reading the entire book.
