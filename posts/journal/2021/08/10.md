- I woke up late again. I finished my MHS at 10:00 -3 (Campinas).

- One month ago, my friend A. came to Campinas to rode a quad with me. We talked about relationships and what do we expect from your partner. Today, I also add **commitment**. That is, we know that we can count on each other even if we're in a bad moment in your life.

- I met J. We're going to work together, and I'll be his mentor. I've met him on Twitter.

- I worked on the SCO project. Unfortunately, I couldn't instantiate applications on the EC2 because I started an ARM computer.
