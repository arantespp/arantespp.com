- I woke up early, before 6h00.

- I decided to read [Getting Things Done](/gtd) blink to create an Instagram post, but I need to read more to summarize better.

- I'm not using the GTD system properly. To change this, I'll focus on weekly review to my notes process until it becomes a habit.

- I talked with J. and F. about a project we'll execute together using React Native. I told them that I don't know how to deploy on App Store, and J. was worried about it. I think it was better to tell the truth to them instead of hiding what I didn't know.

- It was my fifth day at Entria. I worked on a WebSockets connection to make the dashboard real-time. It worked on my computer but not on the staging environment.

- At night, E. and R. and I were to eat pizza. We talked about how to use technology to make money. **How do we find the money?**

- I met J. after five years.
