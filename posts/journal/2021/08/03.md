- I finished my MHS at 8h30 today.

- I bought a Pilates ball to be my chair.

- I gave my first mentorship to E. It was fantastic to meet him.

  - We talked about
    - Learning.
    - Clear thinking.
    - Soft skills.
    - Hard skills.
  - He told me that I should tweet my studies more.
  - We decided to create a full-stack project together.

- I'll create a thread about clear thinking.

- My day was productive. I'm doing 30/10 Pomodoro.

- At night, I talked with V. and L. about Modapi to understand its process better.
