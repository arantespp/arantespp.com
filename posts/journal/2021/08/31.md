- In my meditation today, I concluded that my executor self is magnificent (Grammarly suggestion ðŸ˜‚), but my manager self doesn't. So I need to improve my self-management.

- I worked on ttoss Modules.

- I talked with R. about one-day PRs because she didn't understand the concept very well because I didn't explain it clearly.

- I studied the [principle Q5 of Flow](/books/the-principles-of-product-development-flow#q5-the-principle-of-queueing-variability-variability-increases-queues-linearly).
