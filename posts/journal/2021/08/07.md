- I read articles about stop chasing women and improve yourself. If you pursue women as your life priority, you seem weak and needy, which is very unattractive.

  - Sometimes I can't resist, I feel the need to talk to women, and I take this as my priority.

- I read about [chakras](/tags/chakra) and glands. I believe that they significantly correlate to each other.

- I sent a message to N. asking if she wants to talk. Did I seem needy in her perspective?

- I bought shoes and some t-shirts for my model course tomorrow.
