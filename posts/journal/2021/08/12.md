- I create my Discord server to give mentorship to J.

- I'm leveraging my time. I'll teach people everything I know, and I'll ask them to share what they're learning.

- I finished integrating the SCO App and API.
  - I decided to use CloudFront to host admin, but it didn't work because API is HTTP.
