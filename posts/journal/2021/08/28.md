- I come back to Campinas. I was exhausted, and I slept the whole way home.

- At the bus station, I took the preferential queue without wanting to, and I got upset after realizing what I did. So I need to learn to forgive myself.

- At night, I read a blink about business plans. After that, I will read a lot about business to understand better what a company needs.

- **What are the Eigen pillars of a company?**
  - Market depends on customers' desires. A lot of people with the same desire create a market.
  - In the end, people's desires are the single Eigen pillar of a business.
