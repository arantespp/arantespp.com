- I woke up early, at 4:00 a.m. I thought in two projects:

  1.  Create a robot to handle crypto money flow;
  1.  Create a post editor for my blog, and here we are. I spend my whole morning working on this feature.

- C. and I had a talk with F.D. about a possible partnership among our companies.

- "What are the more essential tasks as CEO," I asked F.D.?
  - Develop people. Understand people to care about the customers.
  - Mission and vision.
  - Strategic plan to reach mission and vision.
  - Business partnerships.
  - Structure the departments.
  - Structured delegation.
