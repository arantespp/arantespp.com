- I read an FS blog that explains how we should read a book to retain more information.

- It was my nephew's birthday, he was so happy. The party was thematic with a dinosaur theme.

  - We sang songs on karaoke and danced to '80s music the whole afternoon.

- I go to Campinas at night from Parana√≠ba.
