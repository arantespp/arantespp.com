- I finished SCO server implementation. I used Docker and EC2 to host the APIs.

  - I thought about creating a mentroship in which I'm going to teach about implementing a similar system.

- I watched "The Man Who Knew Infinity" again, it's a very interesting story. I'm almost sure that Srinivasa Ramanujan could see something that we couldn't see normally.
