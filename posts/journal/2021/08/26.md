- It was my fourth day at Entria. I conducted the daily meeting.

  - R. tell me twice that I need to project my voice. How can I achieve this?

- I visited A., and we talked about life and goals. Someday I've asked him, "How do you handle social interactions so softly?" He told me:
  - Everyone is equals, don't lower either elevate anyone.
  - Three-way success:
    - Perseverance.
    - Knowledge.
    - Commitment - accountability and discipline.
  - Attraction Law works.
  - Read The Power of Subconscious.
  - Nothing is in the short-term.
  - Always believe in what you're doing.
  - Learn how to have good communication and empathy.
