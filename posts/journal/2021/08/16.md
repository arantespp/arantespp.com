- New PMO cycle. I assigned all issues to R. of the Sfl project

- I talked to J. in our mentorship about focused and diffuse thinking.

- "Show proof of work before asking for advice."

- We had a met about the SCO project that lasts two hours. The first hour was reporting the interviews with potential customers, and the last hour was decisions. I'm almost sure that we could have been done the reportings in a text before the meeting.
