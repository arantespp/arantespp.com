- I went to the Backstage course, which was about Instagram. We talked about the Insights functionality.
  - The teacher said that a great way to use Instagram stories is to create a timeline to tell your day to others as storytelling. To do this, you post stories during the day, showing something you're doing. **This kind of post creates a connection with your followers.**
  - Your audience has a delay in knowing what you do. Because of this, you should also post about what you're doing.
