- Third day at Entria. Today I worked with GraphQL subscriptions. We talked a lot about product development and the middlemen of payment between the merchant and the bank.

- Dailies should be energic. The person who conducts it should elevate the team's energy and show how the tasks can correlate.

- A bad daily has:

  - team members don't pay attention to each other;
  - low energy;
  - everyone thinks that their task doesn't correlate to the task of the team's another person.

- Every person on the team should know about product development. In addition, everyone should know a little about the product owner.
