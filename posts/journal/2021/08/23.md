- I visited Entria. I met S., D., R., and E. Unfortunately, I couldn't follow them on Slack and GitHub because they're speedy.

- I was exhausted because that I traveled all night.

- I sent a message on React Brasil telling about an opportunity to work with React Native.

- I went to Airbnb at 19h30.
