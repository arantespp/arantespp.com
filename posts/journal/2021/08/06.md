- I scheduled my second mentorship with J.

- I couldn't improve Modapi's spreadsheet. I don't know how to calculate some values there.

- I received my Pilates ball to use as a chair.

- We worked on the Sfl project on Monday. I liked the way we put the tasks

- I'm asking myself this question often, **How do I improve my branding?**
