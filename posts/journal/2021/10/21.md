- I rushed the Sfl project until 14h. Meantime, I worked on some CAA's tasks.

- At night, we had the executive meeting that K., the CAA's CTO, asked to stop using Expo and start using React Native CLI.

- It was a very tough day. So many projects, and I was pushing myself very hard.

- I had an insight that my context switching is becoming more efficient.
