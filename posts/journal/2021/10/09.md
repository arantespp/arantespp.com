- I woke up early, 5h15, without a clock. It took me one hour and a half to finish my morning routines and wash dishes.

- I worked the whole day doing Barbearia Oliveira App using AppSheet. Therefore, I can say that I mastered AppSheet very well.

- Because I slept in the afternoon, I went to bed late. However, before sleeping, I worked on the authentication of the CAA App.
