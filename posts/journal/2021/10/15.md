- In the morning, I worked documenting the CAA project.

- We had our strategic talk.

- I posted in a Discord server the [Janusz Korczak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janusz_Korczak)'s history, and that I cried when I read it. I felt a lot of discomfort posting my vulnerability, but it was good to increase my discomfort zone.

- At night, something interesting happened. My energy capacity was shallow, and I realized that my will's power had gone. So I watched Netflix from 18h to 24h because I didn't have will's power to do any other activity.
  - I remembered that this happened other times. For example, whenever I'm empty of energy, my will's power is also low, and I spend a considerable amount of time seeing videos on Instagram.
