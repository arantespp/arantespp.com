- I woke up at eight, and I was a little sick because I didn't sleep well this week.

- I met J. on CAA project. We talked about the core library we're implementing.

- I felt uncomfortable because I had some delay in answering some messages on WhatsApp. How can I improve this and answer others faster?

- Our strategic meeting was at 17h30, and C. presented his vision and a goal to reach. His goal was, "Create a selling machine as software house until the end of 2022." We concluded this goal is a risk because we need to rely on developers.
  - We agreed that each of us would present our vision and a proposal for the following year. We scheduled my presentation the next Monday.
