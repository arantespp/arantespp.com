- In the morning, we talked with L. about the CAA project. Then, we asked him to commit every day, ask everything he didn't understand, and be more present in the project.

- I talked with K. about my leadership in the project. It was an exciting talk. He explained how they work and that I need to change the way I lead the team. I have one week to prove that I fit in their culture.
