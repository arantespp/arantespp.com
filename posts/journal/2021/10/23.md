- I talked with D. about our branding. He told me that he does and posts things that he likes and doesn't care about metrics. I agree with him. The best way to create social capital is to provide value to the world and let the time do its job.

- I slept in the afternoon to get rid of the flu. A note to future self: this week, I slept a little, drank milk every morning, ate more candy as usual, and there was a cold day. This note is to my future self discover if milk decreases my resistance.

- I watched some YouTube videos, and I wondered about people with self-light. Every place those people go, they bring joy to the environment. What is their secret? How can you live in the present so intensely that your joy irradiates to everybody else? **How can I spread my light to the world?**
