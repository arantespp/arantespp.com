- We had our strategic meeting today, and we discussed strategies to become a VB. I don't particularly appreciate working with the public sector, and the discussion was about this topic.

  - I also said that I'd like to exit the company if our ideas don't match, and they said that this talk brings insecurity for the team. Should I act correctly?

- I started working on Twitter functionality for this blog.
