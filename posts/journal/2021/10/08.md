- In the morning, I worked on Beer Match checkout.

- It was only my at daily today, again. I didn't feel so bad this time, and I think I handled my emotions better. I don't have control of this situation.

  - It was A.'s last day.

- We did our meeting at 16h00. We talked about an opportunity to work with innovation with a research group.

- In the second part of the meeting, we finished Miro board architecting VB. We have to choose a theme and present our conclusions in the next week. I decided to answer the "How could we chose our market?" question, and I'll use it in my newsletter.
