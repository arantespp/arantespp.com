- I worked on the Sfl project the whole morning and until mid-afternoon to deliver the application.

- I didn't work out because I was very tired.

- I met W.L., your partner on the OneDr project.

- D. sent to me [an article](https://egreb.net/blog/react-auth-with-react-query-and-axios/) about implementing authentication with React Query.
