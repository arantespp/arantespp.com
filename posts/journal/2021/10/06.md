- I worked the whole day validating RN hybrid navigation.

- Even with our last talk, L. didn't deliver any code. So in the afternoon, I talked with F. and J. about this situation. It was a tough day because the burden of the development was huge.

- At night, I went with S. to each Fried pastry at the fair near home.

- When I arrived home, I worked on the Beer Match project until 3h30.
