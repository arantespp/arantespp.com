- It was a holiday. I went to PÃ£o de Queijaria in Valinhos with S. to have breakfast. I asked for bread with cheese, but I'll ask for a stuffed bread cheese next time.

  - I also ordered a lemon "frape," but it was too sweet. As a result, I stayed weary the whole morning.

- I finished [Zero to One](/zero-to-one) and published an [Instagram post](/instagram/zero-to-one).
