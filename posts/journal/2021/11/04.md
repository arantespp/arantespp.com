- I interviewed J. to complete the team on the CAA project. I found him on the devsAcreditar platform.

- I wrote my schedule in the morning. In the afternoon, I didn't do it because I was watching the AWS webinar.

- At night, we talked with W. L. about the OneDr project and the problems we're trying to solve.
