- I woke up at 5h30, tired. I need some days more waking up this time to accustom my body.

- I started my day studying product development.

- We had a meeting in which we discussed offering outsourcing as a product in our company. I argued that it isn't worth it and that we shouldn't do it again. My point is that we can leverage the hours of our professionals if we become good enough to create great products. Instead of receiving \$X by each development hour, we can leverage those hours to transform them into \$10X. It's our job to increase our team members' hours value.
