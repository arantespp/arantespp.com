- I finished the book The Unfair Advantage, but I didn't create my summary yet.

- I went with S. to Parque Ecológico Monsenhor Emílio José Salim run and practice exercises. I took a [photo of the most beautiful tree](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWRXG8ALxu2/) I've seen in my life.

- After training, we went to Sucão and ordered a salad as a diner.
