- I finished the summary of the book [Lean Startup](/lean-startup).

- At your weekly meeting, we started to talk about our studies. I talked about the Building Insanely Great Product and The Unfair Advantage that I was reading.

- At night, I read about blockchains and which one I'm going to choose to create my NFT project.
