- I felt unmotivated to work in my company because we constantly exchange our hours for money. So I don't want to work on CAA anymore because I'm not creating anything for my company.

- Working on my Twitter project, I did some math. Considering that I want a proportion of $18\%$ of tweets to go to weekdays and $5\%$ on weekends if I create $n$ tweets per day, I'll have:

| $n$ | Weekday | Weekend |
| --- | ------- | ------- |
| 1   | 1.26    | 0.35    |
| 2   | 2.52    | 0.70    |
| 3   | 3.78    | 1.05    |
| 4   | 5.04    | 1.40    |
| 5   | 6.30    | 1.75    |
| 6   | 7.56    | 2.10    |

- Tweeting four times a day is good.

- I realized that not everybody would own 1 BTC.
