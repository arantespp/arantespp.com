- I should have finished the Siflor project, but some problems happened in the morning. First, I created the CAA project on my account, transferring it to CAA. Everything goes well. Second, Migadu blocked the e-mail of our client because they overflowed the limit rating. Everything goes well, too, because Migadu has excellent support.

- I talked with J. in the afternoon to start working on the CAA project. I don't know if I'm a good dealer. But, I know that I need to improve my negotiations skills.

- I stopped working early and continued reading [The Web of Life](/b/the-web-of-life) until 22h00, such an hour I fell asleep to wake up early.
