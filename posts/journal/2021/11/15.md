- I worked at CNPEN while I was waiting for S. to finish her job. It was the last day we saw each other before we travel; she'll travel because she is on vacation, and I'm going to Auriflama.

- S. asked me why I was trying to wake up so early. I told her that I was planning this because I wanted to create a massive impact globally, and I needed to study as much as possible. Waking up early gives me some hours to explore more the topics I need to learn. To drawback is that I'll lose my nights, but I'm willing to pay this price.

- I couldn't create a summary for the book [The Unfair Advantage](/the-unfair-advantage).

- I bought Your Music and People because I think it'll be good to help me create my "music and people."
