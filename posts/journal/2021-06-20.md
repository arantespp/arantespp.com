- I updated my website index page. I added descriptions of the features I've been building over time.

- I recorded myself singing These Days by Take That and posted it on Instagram.

- **I didn't enjoy my day because I didn't decide if I worked or rested. I spend much mental energy thinking about what I should do, and I didn't do anything properly.**

- I watched Arrivals. It's an interesting movie because it talks about non-linear orthography and non-zero-sum games.

- I watched a documentary called "Patrimônio Literário de Mato Grosso do Sul" of my friend.
  - The main lesson I learned is that literature isn't only writing. It also includes speaking, legend, cases, and songs.
