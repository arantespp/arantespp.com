I need to think more about this, but I have a feeling that our explanations of things we're learning follows a sine curve. When we know nothing or a little, we explain with simplicity because we don't know so much.

When we start understanding the subject, our brain is creating connections while we're learning, but they're messy, we don't have enough effective connections. Every piece of information looks like independent but at the same time, may be connected to each other. At this point, we can't explain in a concise way because we don't know how the pieces effectively correlated. It's like a thousand piece puzzle that we just opened and throw the pieces on the table. Trying to explain is like catching pieces randomically and trying to create a explanation of how these pieces fit together, even if they don't.

At the final stage, when we understand the whole subject, the connections in our brain are well defined and clear. When this happens, we are able to explain plainly. At this point, your puzzle is finished and, for every group of pieces we pick up, we can show clearly because they fit together and we don't have to create complexes explanations, it's straightforward. It's simple.

## The Feynman Technique

This technique was used by [Richard Feynman](/zettel/richard-feynman) while he was learning some subject. The method consists in four steps:

> 1. Choose the subject you want to learn and write down everything you know about the topic.
> 2. Try to explain what you know to a child. When you're speaking with a child, you should be clear and concise.
> 3. Identify gaps in your explanation. If you're struggling to explain clearly, go back to the material.
> 4. Review, organize and simplify.

The [Feynman Technique](/zettel/the-feynman-technique) benefit is that it helps we assemble the puzzle in our head. When we force ourself to explain some topic to a child, we are forced to remove all complexities of our arguments, we have to figure out how to create the best connections. We can choose the least amount information that don't increase the complexity but that gives the most important overview of that topic - Pareto Principle. We can explain using 20% of the pieces and they give to our listener 80% of the topic overview. We don't need to talk about the huge amount of blue pieces of our puzzle that represents the sky as they aggregate less relevance to the picture.

## Mental Models

[Mental models](/zettel/mental-models) are information _templates_ that we can use to [understand situations](/zettel/system-mental-models) in our lives or to make [decisions](/zettel/decision-mental-models). Sometimes, when we learn some topic, we attach that topic to a specific context. When we extract a mental model from the topic we're learning, we can use that template in others contexts.

For instance, when I first learned about [entropy](/zettel/entropy) in high school, I highly attached it to thermodynamics and physics and I thought that it could be used in this context. However, if we transform entropy in a template, in a mental model, we may use in others contexts.

EXPLAIN WHAT IS ENTROPY IN THERMODYNAMICS

GIVE EXAMPLES OF HOW MIGHT WE USE ENTROPY PRINCIPLES TO EXPLAIN CODE TECHNICAL DEBT, BITCOIN OR A HOUSE THAT ARE NOT CLEANED.

In our analogy, using a knowledge in a specific context only is like we assemble the puzzle in a table and cannot move it from there. Transforming it in a mental model is like assembling it in a frame. We can use the frame in our living room, bedroom, or even in another house.

## How Can We Use Both Together?

Since I've started blogging, I've been reading a lot of topics, from [psychology](/tags/psychology) to [database systems](/tags/database). But at the same time, I've always been thinking in how to improve the knowledge retention, how to retain the knowledge more efficiently. An advantage of blogging is because I force myself to read and understand well the topic because my notes will be online and everyone can read them. But, even if I'm wrong, someone can tell me the right path and I'll continue learning. [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/).

Explain to a child (mentally) the topic I'm learning and figuring out which mental models I can extract from it is the best way I found to retain the knowledge. Associated to them, I'm also using the [Zettelkasten](/zettel/zettelkasten) to create small pieces of ideas and building the connections through tags and references. So while I write my notes, I try to write them as simple as possible, in a way that a child can comprehend the idea. I also keep trying to extract mental models. If I discover one, I open a new note and write about that mental model and how can we use it.

I'm enjoying The Feynman Mental Model Technique. I can assure to you that it's already making difference for me, even though I have this blog for only one year. I'm focusing in a long-term result. I believe the results are exponential and the greatest outcomes will come in some years. I'll keep you in touch and I'll share with you the result of this project.

## Systems

The last part of this technique is the systems you should create to support it. You can ask yourself, "How can I set up a system that makes me apply this technique so easily, and I don't need to rely on my motivation?" You can ask this question to many others parts of your lifeâ€”to create habits or be more productive in your work. Creating systems is creating a passive environment that supports you for whatever you want to accomplish.

For this methodology specifically, I created this blog to support it. I wanted X prerequisites:

1. A system in which I could write notes easily.
1. I could search and connect notes through tags and references.
1. I could share it with many people.

Your system's requisites may diverge a little bit. Depending on your choice, you can fork this blog, use Notion, Obsidian, or even paper notes. It doesn't matter which one you choose for yourself, as long as you eliminate most frictions and make your job easier.

## The Last Resistance

The last resistance is a barrier that doesn't allow applying this technique (or doing any other job). It's more difficult to sit to do the work than to do the work. Procrastination.
