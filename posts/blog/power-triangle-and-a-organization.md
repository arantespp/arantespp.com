## The Basics About a Power Triangle

## An Organization like a AC Circuit

A organization can be seem very like a power triangle. If the bureaucracy increases, it's more like that they won't have the tasks done - more reactive power. The real source of power, money, will be used to pay the bureaucracy and the ones who effectively do the job.

Think in a full reactive power circuit, phase 90º. If an organization is full reactive, it'd be more like this:

1. In a moment **t1**, a person A is doing job effectively (peak of the sinusoid) and delegate a task to a person B. At this time, the person B is doing nothing that generates value to the organization (the sinusoid is crossing the X-axis) because they're in 90º phase.

1. In a moment **t2**, the person B receives the task and has his/her sinusoid at the peak and he/she is executing the task. Because the bureaucracy, the difference between **t1** and **t2** leads person A to be ineffective now (crossing X-axis) and won't get nothing done when person B send to him the task.

1. The loop repeats indefinitely.

This is a capacitor and inductor circuit, in which they only exchanges energy to each other - while one sends, other storage energy. No energy leaves the system, in other words, no real energy is produced.
