title: My Story - Use Non-Zero-Sum Games to Protect You
---

Today I went to a digital marketing course that I started with Backstage Models in Campinas, SÃ£o Paulo. Our class was about Instagram and how it can be suitable for anyone who wants to sell online. The platform is also good if you're going to create capital social and be an influencer. But wait, I won't talk about Instagram in detail. Instead, I'll talk about how using zero-sum games mentality makes me feel bad at the end of the class, and non-zero-sum games were the opposite.

This post will be a note to me to never forget about the experience I had today.

Let's go to the end of the class, in which the teacher asks us to make groups of four and give feedback to each other Instagram profiles. It was great talking and knew each one of them a little bit more. After some time, the teacher finished this activity and called everyone to take a picture of the whole class. After the shot, things became fascinating.

After the picture, everyone started to create Instagram stories as part of our class. I stayed at the center of the room trying to make a video (it was my first video story that I was talking about). It took about two minutes to create the video and post it. In this meantime, I saw my group taking pictures to post on Instagram, people passing by me without talking, and many other typical actions. Until this point, is the situation pretty normal, right? It depends. Are you looking from which perspective?

Before continuing this text, I want to give you more context. I read about non-zero and zero-sum games about five months ago when I read the Naval Almanack. I loved the theory behind these king of games, but I hadn't had the opportunity to put them in practice because of the pandemic until today.
