I wrote this post because I'm working with all the operations departments in my company, and I want to understand the advantages of giving equal importance to them. To do that, I decided to think about the extreme opposite, which is focusing on a single department: Engineering, Product, Design, Marketing, Sales, Customer Support, and Operations.

Just a note, I want to clarify that the idea of departments isn't to be used to divide the company into smaller groups and silos. The notion of departments is to make it easier to understand the company's operations. For example, if you want to know how the company sells products, you can focus on the sales department. You can concentrate on the marketing department to understand how the company promotes its products. I advocate for cross-functional teams, in which people from different departments work together to solve problems. However, it's essential to understand the operations of each department.

Saying that a company is "department-first" means that the specific department is the most important and receives the most attention and resources. This approach can be beneficial on one side, but there can be some drawbacks. For example, other departments may receive less attention and resources, which can negatively impact the company's overall performance and customer satisfaction.

Let's dive in and see the drawbacks and benefits of focusing on a specific department.

## Engineering

An engineering-first approach can sometimes lead to a narrow focus on technology and building technically impressive products at the expense of other important factors, such as market trends, customer needs, and business goals. For example, it may build a product with the best code, compelling technologies, and best practices. Still, it doesn't solve a real problem for the customer and needs a business model that can generate revenue.

The benefit is that the company's products and technology are always at the cutting edge and built to the highest standards.

## Product

A product-first approach can sometimes lead to a narrow focus on the product at the expense of other important factors, such as technological innovation and long-term business strategy. A narrow focus on the product means that the company focuses on the development and refinement of the product—the process of creating, testing, and improving—and excludes other essential factors. This approach can lead to a lack of attention to other aspects of the business, such as market trends and long-term business strategy. For example, the company spends much time refining the product and ignores the market trends and time to market.

The advantage is that the company continuously develops its products to maximize value and appeal to customers.

## Design

A design-first approach can sometimes focus on aesthetics at the expense of functionality and performance. For example, the product is designed to be visually appealing but is difficult or frustrating to use. This approach can frustrate customers and lead to poor satisfaction and loyalty. Another example is a product designed to be visually striking but does not function as well as competitors' products or does not meet customer needs. It also can lead to poor sales and a loss of market share. Finally, a focus on aesthetics can sometimes lead to a product that is overly complex or expensive to produce, which can negatively impact the company's profitability and long-term sustainability.

It can be beneficial because it ensures that the company's products are always visually appealing.

## Marketing

A marketing-first approach can sometimes lead to a focus on short-term sales and revenue at the expense of long-term product quality and customer satisfaction. For example, the company may spend a lot of time and money on marketing campaigns that generate short-term sales but do not build a strong brand or customer loyalty. As a result, this approach can lead to a market share loss and sales decline over time.

The benefit is that it ensures that the company's products are always well-known and well-marketed.

## Sales

One potential drawback of a sales-first approach is that it can sometimes result in a lack of focus on product development and innovation. Another disadvantage is that the team may become overly focused on short-term sales and revenue at the expense of long-term product quality and customer satisfaction, ignoring customers' requests and support.

The benefit is that it helps to drive revenue and growth for the company.

## Customer Support

A customer support-first approach can sometimes lead to a lack of focus on product development and innovation because they're too busy solving customer problems and requests. As a result, this approach isn't sustainable in the long term.

The benefit is that it ensures that the company's customers are always satisfied and happy.

## Operations

An operations-first approach is a company that focuses on operations, which means creating processes and systems to make the company more efficient and effective. The drawback is that it can sometimes lead to a lack of focus on product development and customer satisfaction. They spend so much time creating the "best" process and systems that they forget to create real customer value.

The benefit is that it ensures that the company's operations are always efficient and effective and that all departments interact seamlessly.

## Conclusion

Whatever the company departments, focusing on a single department can be beneficial, but it can also have some drawbacks. It's important to understand the disadvantages and benefits of focusing on a single department to detect when a company is "department-first" and not. The best way to avoid the drawbacks is to have a cross-functional team in which people from different departments work together to solve problems.

For me, it was a good exercise to think about (and some of them that I've experienced by myself) the drawbacks and benefits of focusing on a single department. I hope you enjoyed it.
