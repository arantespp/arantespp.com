Finding the right people is the most important thing because talents unlock the organization's potential, mission, and vision. You aren't just hiring a person. You're building a culture. It's essential to evaluate the candidates' value level to see how they fit your team.

Before evaluating candidates' values, you have to define yours. Each company has its core values that should be clear to everyone. For example, some values could be:

- **Passion**: Does the candidate get visibly energized when talking about themselves, past projects, or topics that interest them? Do they want to grow and accomplish? Are they deeply curious?

When hiring, you want to answer questions like, "Would we want to report to this person?", "Would we want to work with more people like this?" You also look for an astounding YES for each question.

But remember, you're testing for values and competence.

## Before Interview

### Experience

You should also consider that a candidate seeking a specific role that checks all the boxes of skills and experiences may be a red flag. Doing the same activities that you've already nailed is the safest route. People who have a growth mindset dare to take risks, stretch themselves to learn, and have the resilience to fail and move forward. It depends on your company's culture to decide which kind of people you'd hire.

## During Interview

During your interviews, you have to test for technical skills and competence, assess if the candidate fits with the company's culture and values, and market yourself and the company.

For testing values, here are some great questions to try:

- What motivates you?
- How will this role challenge you?
