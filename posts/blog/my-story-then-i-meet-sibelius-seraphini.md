title: My Story - Then I Met Sibelius Seraphini
---

My last talk with Sibelius was about inflexion points in our lives. I've already told this to him, but met him was an inflexion point for me.

I can't remember the exact day we start talking, but I bet that was because this tweet.

![tweet](<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s not that easy. <br><br>I started using Twitter three days ago and wasn&#39;t easy to write my first tweet.</p>&mdash; Pedro Arantes ðŸŒ¹ (@arantespp) <a href="https://twitter.com/arantespp/status/1197522233801027584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>)

I was learning [React.js](/zettelkasten/react-js) when I decided to participate of a group called [React Brasil](https://react.now.sh) on [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-br/), created by him. Sibelius was (and still is) an active member of the group. He is always helping people with their questions and posting interesting articles, not only about technology. I remember that my first thought about him was, "Who is this guy that keep posting a lot in this group?"

At that time, I wasn't using Twitter so much because I was afraid about what people would think about my tweets. After sendind that reploy to Sibelius, he messaged me on Slack asking how it was going using Twitter. I think that was our first talk.

Since this day, we start to talking often and every talk with him was a storm of ideas and articles recommendations that I couldn't follow, I always needed sometime to capture all the ideas. At the beginning, I commonly think, "This is not possible, I bet that neither him read all those stuffs."

Since that day, I've been learning and improving myself so much because of him.

I've learned and done many things since we started to talking. I'd like to share with you a little of what I learned and I hope that this text inspire and change many people as I.

## Creating

I just started this blog because our talks. Sharing knowledment was unusual for me because my normal was reading something, keep it with me, talk with others sometimes, and nothing more. I was a read-only person that only consumed knowledge from the world but didn't give nothing in return.

He once told me that "you don't be remembered if you don't share." It was a chain of decisions after. I started following many people that also creates; I started to write some posts; I started to share and interact more with the developers community; and I liked it.

Seeking for knowledge was also a consequence. Once I started to write more, I needed to read more to give basis and references about I was writing. [Zettelkasten](/zettelkasten) method I first saw because he make a question on Slack if someone knows the method. My entire blog was architected to support the [Zettelkasten](/zettelkasten) method, that relies on creating notes and linking the through backlinks and tags.

## Seeking for Knowledge

Seeking for knowlegde and share was unusual for me.

## You Don't be Remembered if You Don't Share

I started this blog because of our conversations.

## Consistency

## Create, Active Power

## Don't Care About Others

Finally, this is the last topic of this article. It's how I started this text and how I'm going to finish it. As I said, sharing was a bit scaring for me. Now, it's natural.

## Final

A discovered later, but we were at the same university at the same time, from 2011 to 2015 in SÃ£o Carlos.
