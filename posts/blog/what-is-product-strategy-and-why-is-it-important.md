In its simplest form, [product strategy](/zettel/product-strategy) is a business plan for its products—the long-term [vision](/what-are-mission-vision-and-values) and planning for a company's product line. It involves the company's overall business strategy and objectives, deciding what products to develop and bring to market, market trends, customers' needs, and how to promote and sell them. A well-crafted product strategy can be a significant asset for a company, giving it a clear [roadmap](/zettel/product-strategy-roadmap) for success.

It's important to remember that product strategy is the "how," product vision is the "what," and the roadmap is the "when."

The product strategy aims to create a roadmap for developing products that will meet the target market's needs and help the company achieve its business goals. There are a few prerequisites to creating a product strategy roadmap. You need to:

1. Clearly understand your company's business strategy and objectives.
1. Understand the needs of your target market and what trends are impacting that market.
1. Have a team in place that is capable of executing the product strategy.
1. Have the resources to support the product strategy's implementation.

## Tools

Some [tools](/zettel/product-strategy-tools) help you craft your company's product strategy, like market research, competitive analysis, customer surveys, business planning, financial modeling, and product development.

However, the most effective tool is the "do." The question "What do you need?" is the wrong question to ask your potential customers when doing market research. Instead, you should ask, "What do you do?" You should act like a social anthropologist and discover what they do.

Observe your customers and prospective customers and try to find answers to these questions:

- What do you do?
- How do you do it?
- Why do you do it?
- Where do you do it?
- When do you do it?
- What's standing in your way?

Then you can translate those "do's" into wants and need and create real solutions that people will buy, not just a technology that may or may not solve a problem.

## Examples

Apple's "Think Different" campaign is an example of a successful product strategy. The company based the approach on the idea that the company should focus on developing unique and innovative products rather than trying to compete with other businesses by offering similar products.

Another example of a successful product strategy is Amazon's "Prime" program. The company should focus on developing a program that would offer free shipping for customers who purchased items from Amazon. As a result, Amazon was able to attract more customers, and the program has been successful in helping the company to compete with other online retailers.

An example of an unsuccessful product strategy is Microsoft's "Windows Vista" campaign. The idea was that the company should focus on developing a new operating system that would be more user-friendly and compatible with other software programs. However, the product was not well-received by consumers, and Microsoft was forced to release a new version, "Windows 7," just a few years later.

## Conclusion

Every company should have a product strategy before development begins, especially about discovering the market's needs and if the product solves a real problem. Unfortunately, many mistakes are just identifying a few parts of the strategy and then jumping into development, which causes much waste. The opposite is also true; you should avoid aiming to create the perfect product strategy document and not execute the idea.
