I wrote this article as an exercise to understand the characteristics of the Product Manager's role. This idea came after reading a [Shreyas Doshi](https://twitter.com/shreyas) thread in which he explained some traits of Good and Great Product Managers.

While reading, I asked myself, "Great thread explaining the Great and the Good Product Managers, but what about the Bad and Okay ones? If I know the characteristics of Bad and Okay Product Managers, I know what I shouldn't do."

## Topics

For each tweet of the original thread, I created a section with the characteristics of each PM. The **Good** and **Great** is the original one, which I copied from the tweet. As part of my exercise, I tried to explain each topic briefly and fill in the **Bad** and **Okay** PMs attributes.
