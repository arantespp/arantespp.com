I wrote this article as an exercise to understand the characteristics of the role of a Product Manager. This idea came after reading a [Shreyas Doshi](https://twitter.com/shreyas) thread in which he explained some traits of Good and Great Product Managers.

While reading, I asked myself, "Great thread explaining about the Great and the Good Product Managers, but what about the Bad and Okay ones? If I know their characteristics, then I know what I shouldn't do."

## Structure of this article

For each tweet of the original thread, I created a section with the characteristics of each PM. The **Good** and **Great** is the original one, which I copied from the tweet. As part of my exercise, I tried to explain each topic briefly and fill in the **Bad** and **Okay** PMs attributes.

The heading of each topic is the number of the original tweet plus a title that explains the topic, for example, [**1/ Deliver**](#1-deliver). After that, I wrote a question that clarifies more about the topic. Finally, bullets explaining how **Great**, **Good**, **Okay** and **Bad** PMs act on the topic context. The bullets also answer the topic question.
