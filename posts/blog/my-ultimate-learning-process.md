# My Ultimate Learning Process

I've always been fascinated by learning and learn faster, more efficient and with better quality. I don't remember the exact time, between 2011 and 2015, when I was in college, but trying to improve my learning process I started to practice fast reading. In fact, I was reading a lot more than before, more books, articles, newspapers among others with less time. I was happy, because I thought I was learning more, but I was wrong. Very wrong.

Fast reading is very good for skimming, but not for retention. Took some time to realize that I was fooling myself thinking I was learning more because after some days or hours, I couldn't remember what I've had reading before. Really!

The process is

- choose some subject I want very much to learn
- apply slow reading
- create some notes using Zettelkasten
- write these notes in public
- write an essay with this subject joining others notes from others subjects.

This is essential for me. When I want to learn about something I get involved by that topic and my retention increases. Nowadays is uncommon I choose some subject I don't want to learn, but it has already happened to me. I remember when a friend tell me about X with tremendous passion that I become curious about that. But once I started to reading an article about X, I realized how many my mind divagate when reading. So, just a few or almost none motivation won't make me learn something.

But you could think that being this way will lead you to now know another fields and ideas and I agree with you. If I study only things I think I like I will have a small vision of the world. However, there is a trick we can use to overcome that: find a very strong reason to learn something. For instance, a good reason for me in this case is just thinking that I could discuss with my friend about X and enjoy that passionate moment with my friend (I really love people that love something and share that love with the world).

Forget about reading fast here. I'll prove to you why it doesn't work. (EXPLAIN ABOUT SHORT AND LONG TERM MEMORY).

The advantage of fast reading is that you can execute a first skimming reading to know to whole topic. Once you know the whole, you apply reading metacognitively, question yourself if that paragraph is true or if that can be correlated with other topic you know. This applies to learning exact sciences, but also the slow reading here includes solves some equation and modeling a problem.
