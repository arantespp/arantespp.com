I've been studying time for the last few months, and it turned out to be one of my favorite topics. Some say that the invention of time was the greatest humankind invention, but sometimes I think that the way we understand time now is a local maximum. The book [Stories of Your Life and Others by Ted Chiang](https://www.amazon.com.br/Stories-Your-Life-Others-English-ebook/dp/B00L2EQODK/), which inspired the movie Arrivals, tells about the nonlinearity of time (time goes from past to future) and how it influences the way we think and write.

Time and space are other interesting topic about time. Time passes slower if you're in a region with massive gravity (I recommend the movie [Interstellar](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)>)). Hours in a black hole may be equivalent to years on Earth. I mentioned this to reinforce the idea that time isn't linear. In this case, the time's duration is different for each observer, depending on the events they're experiencing.

The nonlinearity of time also happens when we correlate it with money. Some people can make enormous money in a span, while others make less. Why did this happen? Why do people make different amounts of money in the same period?

We can group the correlation between time and money into five categories, which we'll discuss below.

## Your time doesn't make money

Everybody starts here. We don't earn money when we're a child or use our time in college or learning something new. In this category, we're preparing ourselves with capabilities to allow us to exchange your time for money. This level is essential because it determines how far we'll reach the other categories.

If we use our time wisely in this period by reading books, practicing our art, taking courses, and so on, we'll develop our production capacity—knowledge and skills. If we don't, we'll be stuck in this category or can't go so far in the others.

## You have a limited-time job to make money

After learning some skills, you can use them and find a job within a limited-time window, so you work with a fixed schedule; for instance, you work from 8 am to 5 pm. The main point of this category is that someone has set the time window for you, and you don't have the freedom to choose when you work.

The hours you're allowed to work, and the maximum salary you can earn in your profession determines the max amount of money you can make at this level. For example, if you have to work 8 hours per day and your salary is $100 per hour, you can make a maximum of $800 per day. To increase this maximum value, you need to improve your skills or find a better job to raise your salary, but the time window limit will remain.

## You don't have a limited-time job to make money

People in this situation control have more control of their time window—their time is more flexible. This category includes freelancers, reviewers, consultants, doctors, and artists. If they want to make more money, they can work more. But still, there is a time limit per day. No one can work more than 24h per day.

## You leverage your time to make money

How could you do that if you want to make more money than the amount limited by 24h? By leveraging your time. Leveraging your time means you work by an X amount of time, but it is the equivalent of Y people or technologies working X for you.

You can achieve this by writing a course once and selling it multiple times. You spent X time creating and maintaining it, but you multiply it by the number of people who buy it.

Another example is when you start a company. If you're successful, your company doesn't need you to do operational tasks anymore. So instead, the time you dedicate to it is some hours in a month, participating in board meetings and making higher-level decisions.

## You use the money to buy time

The last category is when you have enough money to buy time—some say this is wealth's definition. You can buy time by hiring people to do all your activities, from cleaning your house, driving, and cooking, to taking care of your business. You can spend all your time doing wherever you want.
