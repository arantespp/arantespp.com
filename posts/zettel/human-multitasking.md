## Notes

- Multitasking is the "ability" to perform more than one task or activity at the same time.

  - In reality, the brain is incapable of performing multiple tasks simultaneously. It cannot truly multitask. [Reference](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2009-08-multitasking-ability.html)

  - **What you're doing is quickly shifting your attention and focus from one thing to the next.**

- It isn't good for productivity. [Some researches](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0096-1523.27.4.763) suggest that multitasking can reduce productivity by as much as 40%.

  - Distractions happen more easily when you switch from one task to another.
  - Cause mental blocks.
  - More predisposed to errors.

- Even people who consider themselves heavy multitaskers are not very good at multitasking ([reference](https://www.pnas.org/content/106/37/15583)).

  - Those people were worse at sorting out relevant information from irrelevant details.
  - The most frightening results happened when multitaskers weren't multitasking. When chronic multitaskers were focusing on a single task, their brains were less effective and efficient.

- On the other hand, multitaskers who use more than one form of media or type of technology at once perform better at integrating visual and auditory information (multisensory integration) ([reference](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-012-0245-7)).
