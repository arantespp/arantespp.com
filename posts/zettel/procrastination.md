## Notes

- Procrastination is the action of delaying or postponing something.

- We may procrastinate because a task might be stressful and we prefer to avoid negative emotions - [Pleasure Principle](/zettel/pleasure-principle-psychology).

- It's also correlated to [time management](/tags/time-management).

  - People tend to delay completing a task to make sure it is done "perfectly" - [Perfectionism](/zettel/perfectionism-psychology.md).
  - In a linear culture, people tend to stop doing some task if the time allocated to it has finished.

- It may cause anxiety. As the deadline of a procrastinated task grows closer, they are more stressed and anxious and may decide to procrastinate more to avoid this stress.
