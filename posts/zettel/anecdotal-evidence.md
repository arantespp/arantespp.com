## Notes

- Anecdotal evidence is a factual claim relying only on personal observation, collected in a casual or non-systematic manner.

- It's generally regarded as limited in value due to several potential weaknesses compared to objective and verifiable evidence.

- It may be considered within the scope of a scientific method as some anecdotal evidence can be both empirical and verifiable, e.g., in the use of medical case studies.

- Authority powers anecdotal evidence.

- It's a type of [inductive argument](/zettel/inductive-argument).

- Anecdotal evidence is often unscientific or pseudoscientific because various forms of [cognitive bias](/zettel/cognitive-bias) may affect the shreds of evidence.

- Some definitions of anecdotal evidence:
  - _"Casual observations or indications rather than rigorous or scientific analysis."_
  - _"Information passed along by word-of-mouth by not documented scientifically."_
  - _"Evidence that comes from an individual experience."_
