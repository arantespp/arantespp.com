## Notes

- Testosterone is the primary sex masculine [hormone](/zettel/hormone).

- It plays several important roles, such as:

  - The development of the penis and testes;
  - The deepening of the voice during puberty;
  - The appearance of facial and pubic hair starting at puberty;
  - Muscle size and strength;
  - Bone growth and strength;
  - Sex drive (libido);
  - Sperm production.

- Adolescent boys with too little testosterone may not experience normal masculinization. For example, genitals may not enlarge, and the voice may not deepen normally.

- Signals sent from the brain to the pituitary gland control the production of testosterone in men. The pituitary gland then relays signals to the testes to produce testosterone.

  - A feedback loop closely regulates the amount of testosterone in the blood. When testosterone levels rise too high, the brain sends signals to the pituitary to reduce production.

- Testosterone is also essential in females. These hormones are thought to have important effects on ovarian function, bone strength, and sexual behavior.
