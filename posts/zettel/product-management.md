## Notes

- Product management is the intersection between business, customer needs, [user experience](/zettel/user-experience), a problem, and something that solves the problem.

- "Product management is the art, science, and practice of making successful products." [Shreyas.](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1545222433254232064)

- It's about bringing together the three functions above, a lot of market research, creativity, vision, and more to build value for the customers and the business.

- It also contains a roadmap of interactive and incremental development to help the business reach the vision.
