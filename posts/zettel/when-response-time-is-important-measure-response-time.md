## Notes

If the time on the [critical path](/zettel/critical-path) is worth a lot of money and a support group is on the path, you should measure the group on response time, not efficiency.

Higher efficiency doesn't always lead to a fast response time because higher efficiency means not having waste, so the team doesn't have [slack](/zettel/slack-and-efficiency) and operates at maximum [capacity utilization](/zettel/queue-capacity-utilization).

If response times drive economics, you should align measurements and incentives for support groups to respond time. A straightforward way to move in this direction is to create a quality service agreement that spells out the response in time that users can expect from the department.

For example, in a development team, the developers are always on the critical path of projects. So you should measure how fast they respond to changes, not how many tasks they deliver in a week. This is the core of [business agility](/zettel/business-agility).
