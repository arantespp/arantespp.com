## Notes

- Context switching happens when you jump between tasks.

  - You're on call, but at the same time, you're working on a document.
  - You're watching a movie and checking your mobile.
  - You're writing an email and talking if your coworker.

- It kills productivity.

- It happens when you do [multitasking](/zettelkasten/human-multitasking).

- Each extra task or "context" you switch eats up 20-80% of your overall productivity.
