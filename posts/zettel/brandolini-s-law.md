## Notes

- It states that debunking false, facetious, or otherwise misleading information requires much more energy than producing it.

- It's also known as the **bullshit asymmetry principle**.

- It was formulated by Alberto Brandolini, an Italian programmer, in January 2013.

- In 1906, [Mark Twain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain) dictated. _"The glory which is built upon a lie soon becomes a most unpleasant incumbrance... How easy is to make people believe a lie, and how hard it is to undo that work again."_

- It's a [system mental model](/zettel/system-mental-models) because it explains how fake news becomes viral. It also gives insights into how easy someone believes in information but how hard it is to replace or remove such information.

## Questions

- Are social media catalysts for this law?
