## Notes

The COO is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the organization. They work closely with the [CEO](/zettel/chief-executive-officer-ceo) to develop and implement strategies to improve efficiency and profitability. The COO is also responsible for ensuring that all departments are running smoothly and meeting their goals. In more detail, the COO:

- Oversees all [operations departments](/zettel/operations-departments-of-a-tech-company) and ensures they are running smoothly.
- Develops and implement strategies to improve efficiency and profitability.
- Coordinates with the CEO to develop overall company strategy.
- Ensures that all departments are meeting their goals.
- Maintains communication between departments.
- Resolves conflicts between departments.

The main difference between a CEO and a COO is that the CEO is responsible for the overall strategy and direction of the company. In contrast, the COO is responsible for the company's day-to-day operations.

While the CEO is the 'ideas person,' the COO turns those ideas into reality.
