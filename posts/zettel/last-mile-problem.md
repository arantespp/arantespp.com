## Notes

- The last mile is the last thing to do before finishing something else.
- It's the most inefficient part of the delivery.
- In the telecommunication field, the last mile problem appears when the signal cannot reach more distant places.
  - An optical fiber ring may exist in the dense part of a city but doesn't react edges of the town.
  - Cable branches must be installed so that the signal arrives in the edge.
- On logistics, the products quickly arrive in metropolitan distribution centers, but it's more difficult to reach far or more inaccessible places.
  - These places may be small cities or rural areas.
  - Maybe there isn't good infrastructure to connect these places to the distribution centers, i.e., there is a river between them and needs a ship to deliver the goods.
