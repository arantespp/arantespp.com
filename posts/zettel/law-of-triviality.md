## Notes

- People within an organization commonly give disproportionate weight to trivial issues.
  - If they need to discuss a database architecture (more important) and the color of a button (less important), they'll spend more time discussing the button.
  - This happens because the more important topic the more complex it may be, and the group assumes that the ones who'll work on it understand it.
    - An average person cannot understand it, the majority of the group.
  - The less important topic may be less complex, everyone has an opinion and want to add a personal contribution.
    - **Can result in endless discussion.**
      - Now imagine this scenario and add a lot of bureaucracy and formalisms, like a parliamentary session.
- Also known as:
  - bicycle-shed effect;
  - bike-shed effect;
  - bike-shedding.
- It's a corollary of the [Parkinson's Law](/zettelkasten/parkinson-s-law).
