## Notes

- There are four types of consequences (rewards or penalties) that parents or managers can control - financial, psychic, opportunity, and responsibility.

- **Financial** rewards include income, stock options, allowances, or penalties.

- **Psychic** consequences include recognition, approval, respect, credibility, or the loss of them.

- **Opportunity** includes training, development, perks, and access to influential people and knowledge.

- **Responsibility** is about scope and authority, either of which can be enlarged or diminished.
