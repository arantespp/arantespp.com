## Notes

- In the Kabbalistic lexicon, the _yetzer hara_ is the shadow self that prevents you from actualizing your Self from becoming who you are.

- This shadow self doesn't care about you.

- The Resistance that Steven Pressfield talk about on Turning Pro is the _yetzer hara_. It's also the ego or the lower sphere that the Gnostics and the neo-Platonists believe.
