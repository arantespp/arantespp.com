## Notes

- You can use these four criteria to validate potential virality: absurd, great name, unexpected, and simple.
  1. Something that is a bit absurd lean people to share the content on social media.
  2. A great name makes the content memorable and searchable. It can be descriptive or catchy.
  3. Something unexpected also catches mainstream attention, which increases the chances of sharing.
  4. Something simple to explain and understand removes the friction, and it's easier to reach more people.
