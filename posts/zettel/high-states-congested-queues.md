## Notes

Queues in high-state are the same as congested queues, queues at high [capacity utilization](/zettel/queue-capacity-utilization), with high [WIP](/zettel/work-in-process-wip), or at high level of utilization.

When queues are congested, they create many forms of [economic waste](/zettel/economic-waste-that-queues-create).

## Questions:

- What are the common causes of high-state/congested queues?
