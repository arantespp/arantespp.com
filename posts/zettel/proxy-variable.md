## Notes

- A proxy variable is a measurable variable that isn't directly relevant but is used in place of another unobservable or immeasurable variable.

- Proxy variables interact with other proxy variables.

  - It's dangerous focusing only on one proxy variable.
  - To work with multiple proxy variables, you must express them in the same unit of measure.

- A good proxy variable must have a closer correlation with the variable of interest.

- Examples:
  - Proxy variable per-capita GDP measures standard of living or quality of life.
  - Changes in height over a fixed time are a proxy for hormone levels in the blood.
  - [Slack](/zettelkasten/slack-and-efficiency) can be used to represent an economic impact on a project.
