## Notes

- Set-Based Concurrent Engineering (SBCE) is a product development approach that allows multifunctional teams to ideate, develop, and communicates sets of conceptual solutions in parallel.

- They gradually narrow these sets by eliminating inferior or infeasible solutions as the team progresses and build up the understanding, knowledge, and evidence about the solution sets.

- Critical decisions are purposely delayed until the last possible moment to gather more information before making the decision.

- Foundation framework of SBCE, based on Toyota's best practices:
  - **Principle 1: Map The Design Space**
    - Define feasible regions.
    - Explore trade-offs by designing multiple alternatives.
    - Communicate sets of possibilities.
  - **Principle 2: Integrate by Intersection**
    - Look for intersections of feasible sets.
    - Impose minimum constraints.
    - Seek conceptual robustness.
  - **Principle 3: Establish Feasibility Before Commitment**
    - Narrow sets gradually while increasing details.
    - Stay within sets once committed.
    - Control by managing uncertainty at process gates.
