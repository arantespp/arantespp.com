## Notes

- Business agility is how fast you can deliver the right product to your customers and quickly respond to market changes and customers' demands.

- A company achieves business agility through lean processes that rapidly implement ideas, thus allowing teams to deliver something and get customers' feedback quickly (low time-to-market).

  - It only happens when the whole end-to-end process of the value stream is efficient—high flow efficiency.

- Business agility optimizes value delivery to customers. You only create value for customers when they receive the right product.

- The development process includes, somewhere, the customers as early as possible.

- It integrates the upstream (strategy) and the downstream (development) into a single value stream to create a fast and steady workflow.

  - For this to function correctly, executive management must be on board.

- The goal of business agility is to impact the business metrics positively.

### What is not business agility?

- Agile methods are a means—not the purpose—for achieving business agility.

- When teams hold rituals such as daily standups and team retrospectives, you don't create business agility. That is, at best, local agile development.

- Collecting ideas over a long period and making annual plans kills business agility.

- If what needs to do has already been decided in long-term plans, then the whole business agility has no effects.

- Business agility doesn't work if the organization has agile islands and the surrounding processes remain the same.
