## Notes

- If you have $X$ time to complete some tasks and don't have enough motivation, why should you finish them in less time?

  - [Parkinson's Law](/zettel/parkinson-s-law) acts in this scenario.

- A sense of ownership may be a driver of motivation and may block the effects of [Parkinson's Law](/zettel/parkinson-s-law).

  - An [Atlassian research shows](https://www.atlassian.com/practices/open/research) that teams who have a clear vision of the bigger picture are more effective.

- If you know that your customer needs some feature with urgency (ownership), you may spend $t < X$ time to finish that feature.

- How to create ownership?
  - Shift from a project mindset to a product mindset.
  - Delegate decisions to the lowest level possible.
  - Share information openly.
  - Invest in customer empathy.
