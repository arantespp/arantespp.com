## Notes

- Ethos, together with Pathos and Logos, are persuasion techniques that form the rhetorical triangle.

- Ethos calls upon the ethics, or the values, of the speaker.

- Ethos highlights credibility to appeal to the audience. It tries to convince the listeners that the speaker is reliable and ethical.

- In commercials, an ethos advertisement uses the spokesperson's respect and credibility to endorse the product.
