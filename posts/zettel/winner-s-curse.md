## Notes

- The winner's curse is a tendency in which the winner of a bid in an auction pays more than the item's intrinsic value or true worth.

  - The winner makes the enormous overestimation of an item, thus winning the auction.

- Incomplete information, emotions, and other factors may cause the difference between the paid and intrinsic values.

- Three Atlantic Richfield engineers coined the term winner's course after observing poor investment returns of companies bidding for offshore oil drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico.
