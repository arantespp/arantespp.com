## Notes

- Benjamin Franklin's schedule is a scheme of employment for the twenty-four hours of a natural day.

- He created this schedule to achieve the habitude of the Order virtue.

  - He expected that this virtue would allow him to have more time for his business and studies.

- _ "Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time."_

- Franklin's schedule:

  - **5-7 a.m**. Rise, wash, and address Powerful Goodness! Contrive days' business, take the day's resolution, prosecute the present study and breakfast.
    - _What good shall I do this day?_
  - **8-11 a.m**. Work.
  - **12-1 p.m**. Read or overlook accounts and dine.
  - **2-5 p.m**. Work.
  - **6-9 p.m**. Put things in their places. Supper. Music or diversion, or conversation. Examination of the day.
    - _What good have I done today?_
  - **10 p.m.-4 a.m**. Sleep.
