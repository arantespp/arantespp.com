## Notes

- Also known as **seed accelerator**.

- It's fixed-term and cohort-based programs that include mentorship and educational components for startups.

- At the end of the program, a public pitch event or a demo day occurs.

  - The accelerated startups present their business to investors.

- It generally takes no equity and rarely provides funding.

- The focus of startup accelerators is on small teams, not on individual founders.
  - They consider that one person isn't enough to handle all the work associated with a startup.
