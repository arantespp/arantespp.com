## Notes

Personas bring to life the target consumer and help you understand your customers. There are three personas for a business-to-business (B2B) market: User, Influencer, and Buyer.

- The User is the person who will use the product. They care about the ease of use and whether the product will enable them to do their job.
- The Influencer is the expert on that type of solution, and the Buyer might consult them. The Influencer may not care about the ease of use as the User.
- The Buyer is the one with the money and will care about the price, support, service, and sales terms.

The [value proposition](/zettel/value-proposition) could be different for each type of persona. Likewise, each persona will have distinct goals, so planning to build an insanely great product needs to consider those differences.

The three personas might be one person for the business-to-consumer (B2C) market.

Questions you need to answer to write the personas for the development, marketing, sales, and support teams:

- What do people do?
- How do they do it?
- Why do they do it?
- Who do they do it with?
