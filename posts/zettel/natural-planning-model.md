## Notes

- It's the more effective way to think about projects and situations because it makes things happen sooner, better, and more successfully.

- Your brain needs a complex series of steps to occur before it can make anything happen physically.

- The phases of the natural planning model that your mind goes through to accomplish virtually any task (opposite of the [reactive planning model](/zettelkasten/reactive-planning-model)):

  1. Defining purpose and principles
  1. Outcome visioning
  1. [Brainstorming](/zettelkasten/brainstorming)
  1. Organizing
  1. Identifying next actions

- It's not necessarily normal. People often don't plan this much and end applying the opposite, the [reactive planning model](/zettelkasten/reactive-planning-model).

- It's a [system mental model](/zettelkasten/system-mental-models) because it helps you understand how your brain works when planning something.

- It's a [decision mental model](/zettelkasten/decision-mental-models) because it helps you decide how to plan something you want to accomplish.

## Questions

- How to effectively convince a team to adopt the natural planning model?
