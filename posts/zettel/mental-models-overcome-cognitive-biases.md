## Notes

The usefulness of [mental models](/zettel/mental-models) in overcoming [cognitive biases](/zettel/cognitive-bias) will vary depending on the models used and the particular biases that need to be addressed. However, mental models can help people to recognize and correct cognitive biases by providing a structured way of thinking about problems and decision-making situations. Additionally, by forcing people to consider multiple perspectives on a problem, mental models can help to reduce the impact of biases that can lead people to make suboptimal decisions.
