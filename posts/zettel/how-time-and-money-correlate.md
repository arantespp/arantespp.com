I've been studying time for the last few months, and I can say that it's one of my favorite topics. Some say that the invention of time was the greatest humankind invention, but sometimes I think that the way we understand time now is a local maximum. The book [Stories of Your Life and Others by Ted Chiang](https://www.amazon.com.br/Stories-Your-Life-Others-English-ebook/dp/B00L2EQODK/), which inspired the movie Arrivals, tells about the non-linearity of time and how it influences the way we think and write.

Time and space are other interesting topic about time. Time passes slower if you're in a region with massive gravity (I recommend the movie [Interstellar](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)>)). Hours in a black hole may be equivalent to years on Earth. As we learned, the main point here is that time isn't linear.

This article aims to show the correlation between time and money. I'll show you that time isn't linear when we correlate it with money. Some people can make enormous money in a span, while others make way less. Why did this happen? In the same length of time, why do people make different amounts of money?

We can group time and money into four levels to answer that question.

## Your time doesn't make money

Everybody starts here. We don't earn money when we're a child or use our time in college or learning something new. So this level is essential because it determines how far we'll reach the other levels.

If we use our time wisely in this period, we'll develop our production capacity—knowledge and skills—to do our work and make money.

## You have a limited-time job to make money

After learning some skills, you can use them and find a job within a limited time window. The time window in this scenario is that you work with a fixed schedule. For instance, you work from 8 am to 5 pm.

The hours you're allowed to work and the maximum salary you can earn in your profession limit the max amount of money you can make at this level.

## You don't have a limited-time job to make money

People that are in this situation control have more control of their time. As a result, their time is more flexible. They achieve this by working as freelancers, reviewers, consultants, and many more.

If they want to make more money, they can work more. But still, there is a time limit - 24h. No one can work more than 24h per day.

## You leverage your time to make money

How could you do that if you want to make more money than the amount limited by 24h? By leveraging your time. Leveraging your time means you work by an X amount of time, but it is the equivalent of working X multiplied by Y.

You can achieve this by writing a course once and selling it multiple times. You spent X time creating and maintaining it, but you multiply it by the number of people who buy it.

Another example is when you start a company. If you're successful, your company doesn't need you anymore do operational tasks. So instead, the time you dedicate to it is some hours in a month, participating in board meetings and making higher-level decisions.
