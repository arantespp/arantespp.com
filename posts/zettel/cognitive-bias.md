## Notes

- A cognitive bias is a systematic pattern deviation of the norm or rationality in judgment because the individual constructed reality.

  - An individual's construction of reality may dictate their behavior in the world, not the objective input.

- Cognitive biases may lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or irrationality.

- Some cognitive biases are presumably adaptive because some enable faster decisions in scenarios in which timeliness is more valuable than accuracy, for example, [recognition heuristic](/zettel/recognition-heuristic).
