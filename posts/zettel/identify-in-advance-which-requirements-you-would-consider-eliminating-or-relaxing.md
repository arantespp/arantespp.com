## Notes

In product development, when WIP becomes high, you can [control it by shedding requirements](/zettel/control-wip-by-shedding-requirements). It's best to identify in advance which requirements you would consider eliminating or relaxing for two reasons.

First, you can make a more well-reasoned decision before the pressure of a congestion crisis occurs. Second, if you preplan which requirements your team can scrap, you can structure your product architecture to make it easy to discard themâ€”you loosely couple them to the rest of the system, so you can cut them loose quickly.

## Questions

1. What are some factors to consider when deciding which requirements to eliminate or relax?
2. How can you structure your product architecture to make it easier to jettison requirements later on?
