## Notes

[Napoleon Hill](/tags/napoleon-hill) presented these attributes in [chapter 7 - Organized Planning of the book Think and Grow Rich](books/think-and-grow-rich#chapter-7-organized-planning).

The major attributes of leadership:

1. **Unwavering courage** based upon knowledge of self and one's occupation. No one wants to follow a leader who lacks self-confidence and courage.

2. **Self-control.** Leaders who cannot rule themselves can never control others. The more intelligent followers will emulate the self-control example of their leaders.

3. **A keen sense of justice.** Leaders can't command and retain the respect of their followers without a sense of fairness and justice.

4. **Definiteness of decision.** Leaders who waver in their decisions show that they aren't sure of themselves. As a result, they cannot lead others successfully.

5. **Definiteness of plans.** The successful leader must plan her work and work her plan. A leader who moves by guesswork without solid and definite plans is like a ship without a rudder.

6. **The habit of doing more than paid for.** Leadership demands the leaders to do more than they require of their followers.

7. **A pleasing personality.** Leadership calls for respect. Followers won't respect a leader who does not grade high on all factors of a pleasant personality. Conversely, no slovenly and careless person can become a successful leader.

8. **Sympathy and understanding.** The successful leader must understand her followers and their problems. (The book used the word "sympathy," but I think "empathy" sounds better.)

9. **Mastery of detail.** Successful leadership calls for mastery of details of the leader's position.

10. **Willingness to assume full responsibility.** The successful leader must be willing to assume responsibility for his followers' mistakes and shortcomings. If one of his followers makes a mistake and shows himself incompetent, the leader must consider that it is **he** who failed.

11. **Cooperation.** The successful leader must understand and apply the principle of cooperative effort and be able to induce her followers to do the same.
