## Notes

- Create a "banned words" list. These words are the ones we use in casual conversations.
  - Examples:
    - Just
    - That
    - Already
    - Actual / Actually
    - Think
    - Pretty
    - Really
    - To be
    - Great
    - Around
    - A lot
    - Very
    - Thing
    - Much
    - Unfortunate / fortunate
    - Nice
- Avoid adverbs.
  - Your text becomes more cluttered and slower to read when you use many of them.
- Use conjunctions at the beginning of your sentence.
- Write as you speak, do not try writing with more elegant prose.
  - If you want to write more eloquently, improve the way you speak.
