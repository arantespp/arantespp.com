## Notes

- When you decide to do some task, obligation, or plan without executing it, the mind creates an open loop.

- Open loop is something that needs to be done but hasn't yet been fulfilled.

  - You didn't think about it. You haven't clarified the intended outcome, the very next physical action step, and/or put reminders of the outcome and action required in a system you trust.

- From time to time, your mind will remember that task, even if you can't execute it at that moment.

- A lot of open loops require a lot of mental energy because they stole your attention.

- When you close an open loop, you free your mind.

- It can be large tasks such as planning a trip down to smaller tasks such as make the bed.
