## Notes

- Queue capacity utilization is the amount of time the [service process](/zettel/queue-service-process) is working (not idle).

- [Knowing capacity utilization allows you to predict many characteristics of a queue](/zettel/queue-capacity-utilization-allows-you-to-predict-many-queues-characteristics).

- Percent capacity utilization and percent queue time are identical for a random queue.

  - If you operate an $M/M/1/\infty$ queue at $X$ percent utilization, you're choosing to use $X$ percent queue time.

- [Queues grow when you approach 100 percent utilization, they become exponentially large](/zettel/capacity-utilization-increases-queues-exponentially).

- It's hard to measure capacity utilization directly.
