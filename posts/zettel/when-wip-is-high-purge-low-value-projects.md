## Notes

[The cost of a job when the queue state is low increases when the queue is in a high state](/zettel/the-economics-of-holding-wip-changes-when-queue-size-changes). Therefore, it's logical to purge jobs of low value from the queue whenever there is a surplus of high-value jobs, ensuring open slots for other high-value jobs. You must ask whether it's appropriate to hold jobs in the queue using your economic framework. It's like a hospital moving noncritical patients from the limited number of emergency room beds to serve critical patients.

## Questions

- Why does the cost increase when the queue is in a high state?
- What factors must be considered before deciding on whether or not to hold jobs in the queue?
