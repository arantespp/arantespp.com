## Notes

- Smart contracts are computer programs stored on a blockchain that will be executed when predetermined conditions are satisfied.

- They were first proposed by Nick Szabo in 1994.

- They use simply `if/when... then...` statements that are written into code on the blockchain.
- These actions could include:

  - Releasing funds to the appropriate parties.
  - Registering a document.
  - Sending notifications.
  - Issuing a ticket.

- Once the transaction is completed, the blockchain is updated.

  - It makes the transaction very hard to hack. Hackers would have to change the entire chain to change a single record.

- Only parties who have been granted permissions can see the results.

  - The terms must be agreed upon by all parties.

- They don't need a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism.
