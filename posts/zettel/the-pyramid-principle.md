## Notes

- This principle helps you structure your thinking before you communicate.

- The sequence is:

  1. Start with the answer first.
  2. Group and summarize your supporting arguments.
  3. Logically order and explain your supporting arguments.

- The sequence is good when you present your idea to busy people. You give the answer and conclusion, and arguments first. Then, if they want to discuss the views, they can go into the detailed supporting arguments.

- Sometimes, the executives already came mentally be at our conclusion you want them to reach. So you don't need the third step.

- When you answer the question first, you sound more assertive and confident. You don't need many words to sustain your arguments.
