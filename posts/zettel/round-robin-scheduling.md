## Notes

- It's an algorithm to handle processes and tasks in [computing](/tags/computing).

- It gives time slices, or time quanta, to each process in equal portions and circular order.

- With this algorithm, the system handles low-priority and doesn't get stuck in large jobs with uncertain time to complete.
