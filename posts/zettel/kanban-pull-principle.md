## Notes

- Pull principle is a mechanism for controlling product development workflow.
- The upstream process isn't allowed to take more work unless it has [capacity](/zettel/queue-capacity-utilization).
- A team only picks up the next piece of work from the previous stage when they have available [capacity](/zettel/queue-capacity-utilization)—they've completed other work, and their [WIP](/zettel/work-in-process-wip) won't exceed.
- The opposite is the push principle, in which team members finish their work and push along into the next processing step, ignoring capacity and WIP.
