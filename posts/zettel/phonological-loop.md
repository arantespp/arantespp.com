## Notes

- The phonological loop is a working memory slave.

- It's the voice in your head.

- It has two parts: the **phonological store** that acts as the auditory memory, which decays after about two seconds, and the **articulatory process** that we utilize to prolong the life of the tracks in the store.

- The auditory process is responsible for the dialog between your _inner voice_ and _inner ear_.
