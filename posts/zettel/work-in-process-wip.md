## Notes

- Work in process is how many things a team works on simultaneously.

- Some calls it "work in progress" instead of "work in Process" since the term "process" has a negative connotation in many organizations. The problem in many companies is that they have a lot of work in process that doesn't make any progress. Therefore, "Work in Process" better describes the reality within many organizations.

- A high number of working in the process leads to a high [queue capacity utilization](/zettel/queue-capacity-utilization), which causes problems such as a higher [cycle time](/zettel/cycle-time) and slows down the team's response to changesâ€”the opposite of [agile](/zettel/agile).

- Less WIP means shorter [cycle times](/zettel/cycle-time) and a better [flow efficiency](/zettel/flow-efficiency).

- Too much work in the system diminishes predictability, and adherence to delivery schedules isn't present.
