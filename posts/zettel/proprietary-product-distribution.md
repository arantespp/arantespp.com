## Notes

- Proprietary product distribution is when the company owns the distribution channel of its product. In this case, the company directly contacts its customers and owns all customers' data.

- The opposite is paid product distribution. In this case, there is an intermediary between the company and the customer. The intermediary obtains all customers' data.

- The company that creates a proprietary product distribution has an enormous competitive advantage.

- Many ways to achieve proprietary product distribution:
  - Freemium
  - Community
  - Referral
  - Content marketing.
