## Notes

- It shows that more information is retained in your [long-term memory](/zettel/long-term-memory) by multiple spaced-out study sessions.

- It was first identified by the German psychologist [Hermann Ebbinghaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus) in 1885.

  - He says that even when we've forgotten some information, a certain quantity is stored in your subconscious mind. They cannot be consciously retrieved, but they make the process of relearning more effective.

- To activate this effect, you have to revise concepts of any subject you're studying in spaced-out study sessions.

  - Flashcards are commonly used.

- It can be used to learn anything of any field.
