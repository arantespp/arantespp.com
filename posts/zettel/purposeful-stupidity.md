## Notes

- Purposeful stupidity is a set of instructions that the CIA's precursor, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), wrote in 1944, namely the [Simple Sabotage Field Manual](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/page-images/26184-images.pdf).

- "Citizen-saboteurs" learned those instructions to sabotage organizations or governments institutions.

- Organizations become incompetent and slow after the saboteurs apply the techniques to them.

- Instructions for organizations and conferences.

  - Add bureaucracy to expedite decisions.
  - Talk as frequently as possible and at great length without adding much value.
  - Attempt to make the committee as large as possible.
  - Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.
  - Haggle over precise workings of communications.
  - Refer back to matters previously decided.
  - Be "reasonable" and urge your fellows-conferees to be "reasonable" and avoid haste which might result in embarrassment or difficulties later on.

- Instructions for managers.

  - Always sign out the unimportant jobs first. Assign important jobs to inefficient workers.
  - Insist on perfect in relatively unimportant products.
  - Be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions.
  - Hold conferences when there is more critical work to be done.
  - Add bureaucracy to the processes.

- Instructions for employees.
  - Work slowly.
  - Make as many interruptions as you can.
  - Do your work poorly and blame it on inadequate tools.
  - Never pass on your skill and experience to a new or less skillful worker.
