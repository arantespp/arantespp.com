## Notes

- Exponential technologies are the ones that improve their price-performance basis by more than 10% per year for many decades.

- It means that the price of exponential technologies will decay in some years, and the population can have them at home.

- The most familiar exponential technologies follow [Moore's law](/zettel/moore-s-law).

- Other examples of exponential technologies are batteries for renewables, or solar power generation, which have an 18% to 20% annual improvement.

- Diesel engines or electricity aren't exponential technologies because, at the turn of the 20th century, they had an improvement of 1% to 3% per annum.
