## Notes

- The fight or flight response is a biochemical reaction in animals that enables them to rapidly produce sufficient energy to flee or fight in a threatening situation.

- Walter Cannon discovered this biological reaction.

- When presented with an immediate stressor, the body releases [adrenaline](/zettel/adrenaline), [noradrenaline](/zettel/noradrenaline), and [cortisol](/zettel/cortisol). As a result, the heart rate increases, and blood is directed away from the organs and toward the arms and legs to fight or flee.

- The body spends less energy on functions such as thought, which can prejudice [short-term memory](/zettel/short-term-memory) formation.
