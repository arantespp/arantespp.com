## Notes

Demand-focused approaches to control WIP:

1. [Block All Demand when WIP Reaches Its Upper Limit](/zettel/block-all-demand-when-wip-reaches-its-upper-limit).
1. [When WIP Is High, Purge Low-Value Projects](/zettel/when-wip-is-high-purge-low-value-projects).
1. [Control WIP by Shedding Requirements](/zettel/control-wip-by-shedding-requirements).
1. [Control WIP by Relaxing the Targets for a Unit Cost at Production](/zettel/control-wip-by-relaxing-the-targets-for-a-unit-cost-at-production).

One of the biggest advantages of the demand-focused approaches is the speed at which you can execute them. In contrast, [supply-focused approaches](/zettel/supply-focused-approaches-to-control-wip), which reduce [WIP](/zettel/work-in-process-wip) by adding [capacity to queue](/zettel/queue-capacity-utilization), often have longer response times.

## Questions

1. What is the biggest advantage of demand-focused approaches?
1. Why do supply-focused approaches often have longer response times?
