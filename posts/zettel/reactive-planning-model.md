## Notes

- When a team starts a project without planning, the reactive planning model may ensue.

- [David Allen](/zettel/david-allen) defined this planning in his book [Getting Things Done](/books/getting-things-done#chapter-3-getting-projects-creatively-under-way-the-five-phases-of-project-planning).

- It's a [system mental model](/zettel/system-mental-models) because it helps you understand how a project's execution works without upfront planning.

- The phases of the reactive planning model are:

  1. Identifying next actions
  2. Organizing
  3. [Brainstorming](/zettel/brainstorming)
  4. Outcome visioning
  5. Defining purpose and principles

- Such phases aren't the natural way your mind operates because you try to do actions before organizing, before collecting many ideas, before creating the vision before defining purposes.

- The team reacts to the situation instead of controlling it.

  - When stuff gets out of control, they **act**, word harder, get busier.
  - When having a lot of busy people, someone says, "We need to get **organized**!"
  - After some time, just organizing the problem isn't enough, and someone suggests, "Let's [**brainstorm**](/zettel/brainstorming)!".
  - But the [brainstorming](/zettel/brainstorming) isn't effective because they don't have a clear **vision**, **purpose**, and **principles**. Finally, they ask, "What are we trying to do here?" and start defining the last phase.

- The opposite of this model is the [natural planning model](/zettel/natural-planning-model).

## Questions

- Which scenarios may we observe the reactive planning model?
