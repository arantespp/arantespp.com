## Notes

- Cycle time is how fast a team finishes some work, for example, a product or a feature.

- It is the amount of time a task spends in the system.

- The shorter the cycle time, the shorter the time-to-market.

- If a company takes ten days to deliver a feature to its customer on average, its cycle time is ten days.

- One goal of [business agility](/z/business-agility) is to reduce cycle time.

- To measure the cycle time, the product manager must consider the working and waiting times. For instance, if the team has worked on a feature for one day (active working time) and it has taken nine days to wait for some approval, its cycle time was ten days.

- You can use the [Little's Law](/z/little-s-law) to find the average cycle time $W$ given the average WIP $L$ and the average throughput $\lambda$.

$$
W (\text{average cycle time}) = \frac{L (\text{average WIP})}{\lambda (\text{average throughput})}
$$
