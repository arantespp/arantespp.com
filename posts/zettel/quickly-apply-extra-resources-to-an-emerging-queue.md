## Hypotheses

1. Supply-Focused approaches to control WIP apply additional resources at an emergent queue.
2. Supply-Focused approaches to control WIP often have longer response times.
3. At [high levels of utilization](/zettel/high-states-congested-queues), queues grow much faster than you can shrink them.

## Thesis

To make supply-focused approaches effective, you must minimize the time between the onset of congestion and the application of added resources because queues grow faster than you can shrink, and these approaches have longer response times.

## Questions

1. What are the most effective approaches for quickly applying additional resources to an emerging?
