# Design - Density

## Notes

- Density is defined as how much space has between elements on your screen.
- Principles:
  - Scannable: dense UI allows users to see more content easily.
  - Prioritized: dense UI allows users to focus because it removes spacing between content and actions.
  - Visible: dense UI allows putting more content on a single screen.
- Designers should apply dense UI to display tables, lists, and long forms because the user can scan, interact and compare the information quickly.
- Designers should not apply dense UI in elements that expect more focus from the user, such as dropdown or date picker. Dense UI, in this case, decreases the tappable space, thus reducing usability.
- To create scannable groups of contents, each group should have a high density, and the outer layout (where each group is) should have a lower density. This technique makes the differentiation between the groups easier.
