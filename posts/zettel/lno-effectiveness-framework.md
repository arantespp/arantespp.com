## Notes

- LNO Effectiveness Framework helps you increase your impact on the organization by avoiding spending much time on low-leverage tasks.

- LNO Effectiveness Framework.

  - L - Leverage tasks (10x). Do a great job. Be perfect on these tasks.
  - N - Neutral tasks (1x). Do a strictly good job. No better.
  - O - Overhead tasks (<1x). Just get it done. Don't spend much time on these tasks.

- "Seek leverage, actively try to do a bad job for certain tasks."

- All your tasks have different impacts on your job, so you shouldn't put your best effort into everything.
