## Notes

- It helps you decide which action you take in the present moment.

  - It's a [decision mental model](/zettel/decision-mental-models).

- How to choose between studying about [mental models](/zettel/mental-models), planning an application, or sending a WhatsApp message to your crush?

- It was taken from the book [Getting Things Done](/books/getting-things-done), by [David Allen](/zettel/david-allen).

- The Four Criteria are:

  - **Context**: you're constrained by your environment. Which actions can be done at the place you are? You cannot code with you don't have a computer or anything to write code.

  - **Time Available**: how much time do you have until your next action. If you have a meeting in 10 minutes, you can't start an action that requires more time.

  - **Energy Available**: how much energy do you have? Some actions require physical and/or mental energy. You can't clean the house if you're very tired. You can't study mental models if you're sleepy.

  - **Priority Given**: given the context, time, and energy available, what remaining actions will give you the highest payoff? Here you need to rely on your intuition and judgment call in the moment.
