## Notes

- Chunking is a memorization method in which you group pieces of information in groups.

- This technique helps you memorize better because our [short-term memory](/zettelkasten/short-term-memory) cannot retain a lot of information at the same time.

  - When we group, we can retain the groups instead of each piece of information.

- Also, chunking improves our creativity because we need to create a meaningful connection among groups.
