- Youâ€™re going to have tough some days because you don't have sugars to stimulate your [brain](/brain).

- [Insulin](/insulin) drops to become more stable. Your body won't go through the cycle of sugar highs and crashes.

- Your liver will make ketones from fat since there's no more glucose within three or five days.

- It's common for people to cut sugar and high-glycemic foods for a short period to burn fat. Doctors still aren't sure whether this is healthy in the long term.

- Doctors recommend eating healthy complex carbohydrates.
