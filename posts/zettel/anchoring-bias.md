## Notes

- The anchoring bias occurs when people rely too heavily on the first piece of information they receive when making decisions, which can significantly impact people's decision-making.
- This can lead them to make suboptimal decisions because they do not consider all relevant information.
- The anchoring bias is often seen in negotiation situations, where the first offer can significantly impact the final outcome.
- It can also be important to consider when making decisions about investments or financial products.
