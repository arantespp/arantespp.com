## Notes

- Using the definition of [queueing theory](/zettel/queueing-theory), you can define the queue elements as:

  - Queue: the waiting work.
  - Server: team members—product, engineering, design.
  - Arrival Process: the pattern with which work arrives. It's usually unpredictable.
  - Service Process: the process in which the server accomplishes the work. For example, small deliveries every day.
  - Queueing discipline: how queue handles the waiting work. For example, using [Scrum](/zettel/scrum) or [Kanban](/zettel/kanban).

- Queues in [product development] aren’t physically visible. They go unnoticed and can be poorly managed by teams.

- The idle time of waiting works in queues increases the [work-in-process](/zettel/work-in-process-wip), which is the root cause of much waste in product development.
