## Notes

When you set a limit on [WIP](/zettel/work-in-process-wip), you create positive and negative effects.

### Positive

- Reduces average [cycle time](/zettel/cycle-time).
- It's the easiest way to force rate-matching between adjacent processes.

### Negative

- Permanently reject potentially valuable demand.
- Reduce [capacity utilization](/zettel/queue-capacity-utilization) because you lose the demand you rejected during periods of congestion.
