## Notes

When you set a limit on [WIP](/zettel/work-in-process-wip), you create one positive and two negative effects.

- The positive is to reduce average [cycle time](/zettel/cycle-time).
- The first negative effect is that you permanently reject potentially valuable demand.
- The second negative, you reduce your [capacity utilization](/zettel/queue-capacity-utilization) because you lose the demand you rejected during periods of congestion.
