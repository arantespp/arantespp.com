## Hypotheses

- You trust someone when you think you can predict their behavior under challenging conditions.

- According to [social expectance theory](/zettel/social-expectancy-theory), you work effectively with your peers when you can predict their behaviors, even if they don't share the same attitudes and values.

- If your team does small-batch-size activities, members are exposed to more learning cycles, increasing their behavior prediction.

## Conclusion

Small batch-size activities increase the interactions, increasing their behavior prediction. Once they can foretell how they'll act, they trust each other.
