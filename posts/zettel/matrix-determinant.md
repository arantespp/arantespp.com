## Notes

- It's a scalar value that is a function of the entries of a square matrix.

- It represents the area of the parallelogram defined by the vector columns of the matrix.

- If the value is $0$, then:

  - the column vectors are linearly dependent.

- If the value is not $0$, then:
  - the column vectors are linearly independent;
  - the matrix is invertible.

## Questions

- In one sentence, shows that $\det(M_1M_2) = \det(M_1)\det(M_2)$.
