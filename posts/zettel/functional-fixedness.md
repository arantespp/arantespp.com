## Notes

- Functional fixedness is a [cognitive bias](/zettel/cognitive-bias) that limits someone to use a tool only in the single way they've learned.

- It's the inability to use something and a new way than the usual way.

- It can be a mental block in solving problems in new ways, thus blocking new opportunities and innovation.

- Children at age 5 don't have this cognitive bias yet because they want to reach the goal with any object. However, by age 7, they've already acquired the tendency to consider the specific purpose of the tool as unique.
