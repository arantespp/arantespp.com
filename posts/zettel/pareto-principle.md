## Notes

- The Pareto Principle states that roughly 80% of the consequences come from 20% of the causes for many outcomes.

  - For instance, 80% of funds raised come from 20% of donors.

- Also called **the 80/20 rule** or **law of the vital few**.

- It's a [system mental model](/zettelkasten/system-mental-models) because it explains the proportion between causes and effects.

- Vilfredo Pareto saw the 80/20 connection in 1896 when noted that 20% of the population owned approximately 80% of the land in Italy.

- In business, about 80% of sales come from 20% of clients.

- In economics, approximately 20% of the population owns 80% of Italy's lands.

- In computer science, Microsoft noted that 80% fixing the top 20% of the most-reported bugs, 80% of the erros would be eliminated.
