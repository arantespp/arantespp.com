## Notes

Suppose you have a [cross-functional team](/zettel/cross-functional-team) and use the [Kanban](/zettel/kanban) system to manage your process. Also, you limit the WIP of each step of your development process.

When some step capacity drops (bottleneck), the upstream processes stop creating new work because they reach [WIP](/zettel/work-in-process-wip) limits and downstream processes stop because of WIP starvation (no job). In this situation, if your team can execute the tasks of the bottleneck process, they can help it by increasing its [queue capacity](/zettel/queue-capacity-utilization) for a short period.
