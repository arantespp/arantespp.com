## Notes

- Inflation is the rise of the general prices of an economy in a period caused by [money supply](/zettel/money-supply) growth.
  - Note that the general prices may increase, but the cause may not be by [money supply](/zettel/money-supply) growth, but for supply and demand changes, for example.
- If the inflation is positive, the general prices increases and each unit of the currency buy a few products and services.
- The opposite of inflation is deflation.
  - The general prices of products and services decrease.
- Long period of sustained inflation is correlated with [money supply](/zettel/money-supply) growing rate higher than the economic growth rate.
