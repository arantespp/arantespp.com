## Notes

- This theory states that the way to improve throughput is to speed up the longest step of the system, also known as "elevating the constraint."
- The longest step of your workflow is a constraint on your throughput.
- If the quick steps of your system can produce five items per week (assuming a five-day workweek) and one always takes a week, the overall throughput remains one item per week.
  - If not controlled, the quick steps would build up an inventory of incomplete work, raising [WIP](/zettel/work-in-process-wip) and thus slowing your response time.
- The quick steps might keep your [cycle time](/zettel/cycle-time) short, but they don't impact your throughput.
