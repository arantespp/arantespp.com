## Notes

- Psychologists use the term Social Expectancy Theory to refer to the ability to predict the behavior of other members of your social group.
- You can work effectively with people when you can predict their behavior.
- You don't need others to have similar attitudes and values to yours to trust someone; you just need to predict their behavior.
