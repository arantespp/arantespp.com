## Notes

- Short-term memory can keep information for somewhere on the order of 10 seconds up to 30 seconds, when the information is not being actively rehearsed.

- It has a limited capacity: we can remember $7 \pm 2$ things before them vanish.

  - We can use the [chunking method](/zettelkasten/chunking-and-memory) to remember more things.

- If you want to remember a information beyond a few seconds, it may get stored in your [long-term memory](/zettelkasten/long-term-memory).

- It mostly encode memory acoustically, but also retain visuospatial images.
