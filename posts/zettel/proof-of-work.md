## Notes

- It is a form of cryptography zero-knowledge proof that one part, the prover, proves to others, the verifies, that they used some amount of computational resources to complete some task.

- [Cynthia Dwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Dwork) and [Moni Namor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moni_Naor) invented it in 1993 to deter denial-of-service attacks and other service abuses such as spam.

  - It costs some effort for the attacker to make a request. Thus, it becomes inviable to send a large number of requests in a short period.

- It's asymmetric:

  - It must be hard enough to provers finish the work.
  - It must be easy to validate the prover's result.

- [Bitcoin](/zettelkasten/bitcoin) popularized it.
  - Miners spend some computational resources to append blocks on the [blockchain](/zettelkasten/blockchain).

## Questions

- It is a cryptography zero-knowledge. May we compare this to the gold miners, who need primarily physical force to find gold?

- What is the difference between [CAPTCHA](/zettelkasten/CAPTCHA) and proof of work?
