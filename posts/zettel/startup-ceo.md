## Notes

- The CEO of a startup generally is a member of the founding team. They're the person who has more passion and commitment to the business and understands the problem space better.

- They need to be a strong leader that is good at communicating, negotiating, and selling the company, internally and externally. They are also responsible for enforcing the message that the rest of the team sends out to the world.

- When something goes wrong, they're the ones who'll get the blame.

- They need to give the team the direction and the vision for the futureâ€”a future market, opportunities, new product, service, or technology, a marketing methodology, and a sales channel. It's the kernel idea and the path to go there.
