## Notes

- Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon when a group makes decisions together.
- It can lead to bad decision-making because group members may not express their own opinions or ideas or may not challenge the views of others in the group.
- It can be prevented by encouraging group members to express their opinions and ideas and stimulating debate and discussion within the group.
