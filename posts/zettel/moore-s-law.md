## Notes

- Moore's law is an observation that Gordon E. Moore made in 1965, saying that the number of transistors of an electronic circuit would double every two years, with the cost halved.

- Moore's law implies that electronic devices will become more powerful, smaller, faster, and cheaper with time as transistors become more efficient.

- Moore's law should reach the physical limit at some point in the 2020s. [Reference](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/24/905789/were-not-prepared-for-the-end-of-moores-law/).
