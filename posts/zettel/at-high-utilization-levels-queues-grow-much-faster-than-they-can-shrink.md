## Notes

At high utilization levels, losing capacity generates a queue much faster than regaining capacity can shrink. Remember that [queues grow exponentially as you approach 100% of the queue capacity](/zettel/capacity-utilization-increases-queues-exponentially).

For example, suppose a single lane on a four-lane highway is blocked for 10 minutes in rush hour. In that case, it may create a 40 minutes traffic jam because losing 25 percent of capacity generates a queue much faster than regaining capacity can shrink it.

Questions:

- What strategies could be applied to reduce queue growth at high utilization levels?
