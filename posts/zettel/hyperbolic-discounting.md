## Notes

- This theory states that humans discount the value of a later reward by some factor that increases with the delay's length.

  - People tend to choose a smaller-sooner over a large-later reward as the delay occurs sooner than later.

- It's a [decision mental model](/zettel/decision-mental-models) because it can help you evaluate the reward between two choices at different times.

- It's a [system mental model](/zettel/system-mental-models) because it enables you to understand your and others' choices.

- It's mathematically described as the equation below, where $g(D)$ is the discount factor that multiples the reward's value, $D$ is the delay, and $k$ is the factor governing the degree of discounting:

$$
g(D) = \frac{1}{1 + kD}
$$

- It explains why humans prefer short-term to long-term rewards.

- It reveals a tendency to make choices that are inconsistent over time.
  - We regret some decisions we made in the past, despite knowing the same information.
