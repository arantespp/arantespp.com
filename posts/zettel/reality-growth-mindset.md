## Notes

- "A reality-growth mindset is the ability to accept the hard limits of the way things are (like the physical laws of the universe) and also to believe that anything is possible (the metaphysical way of looking at the universe)." [The Unfair Advantage.](/books/the-unfair-advantage)

- You have to have these two opposing viewpoints and learn to work with them simultaneously, pondering when each one is valid or not. For example, sometimes, you need to believe that you can accomplish the goal to feel inspired and motivated to take action. Other times, it's good to know that you can never achieve something, like being a basketball player.

- It's the balance between self-awareness and self-belief. This duality of thinking is necessary.

- When you live in the extremes, you can live with your heads in the clouds believing _anything_ is possible or with your feet on the ground thinking that you can never be above average.
