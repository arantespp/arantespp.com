## Notes

[Slack](/zettel/slack-and-efficiency) is the degree of freedom. [Queue Capacity Utilization](/zettel/queue-capacity-utilization) is the amount of time the [service process](/zettel/queue-service-process) is working (not idle).

So when your system is operating at maximum capacity utilization, you don't have slack. When it isn't working at its full, you have slack.
