## Notes

There are roles that the founding team of a startup must cover:

- Leading the business ([startup CEO](/zettel/startup-ceo)).
- Creating a strong vision.
- Setting the culture.
- Building the startup team.

They can delegate these roles someday, but the founding team needs to own this responsibility in the early days.
