## Notes

- It stands that a measure ceases to be a good measure when it becomes a target.

- Charles Goodhart advanced this idea in 1975.

- When we pick a feature of the economy as an indicator of the economy, it ceases to function as that indicator because people start to game it.

  - The same happens to statistical variables.

- It's a [system mental model](/zettel/system-mental-models) because it explains how a system works when a measure becomes the target.

- Using multiples targets avoids Goodhart's Law because you must increase them all, not only one.

- If you measure people on the number of nails made, you might get many tiny nails. If you measure the weight of nails made, you might get a few giant and heavy nails.

- Educational systems that measure the students by grades incentivize them to memorize content for a test, then promptly forget it all.
