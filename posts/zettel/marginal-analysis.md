## Notes

- Marginal analysis is a comparison of the additional benefits of an activity and the additional costs incurred.

  - Marginal cost/benefit is an incremental increase in the expense/consumer's benefit a company incurs to produce one additional unit of something.

- Such analysis only considers the benefits of a unique activity in a complex system. In other words, how one variable affects the whole system.

  - You don't focus on the business output as a whole.

- Companies use marginal analysis as a decision-making tool.
