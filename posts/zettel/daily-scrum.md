## Notes

- It's a [Scrum](/zettelkasten/scrum) ceremony whose purpose is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal.

- It's a 15-minute event for the developers of the team. Product Owner and Scrum Master also participate if they're actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog.

- It gives a macro vision of the project. Everyone on the team will be on the same page.

  - Improves the team's level of knowledge.
  - Optimizes the probability that the team will meet the Sprint Goal.

- Each member of the team answer these questions:

  - What did I do yesterday?
    - This question helps managers manage and organize the backlog, priorities, and the value that will be delivered to the product.
  - What do I plan to do today?
    - This question helps each member of the team to create focus and improves self-management.
    - It also gives a little [slack](/zettelkasten/slack-and-efficiency) to each member.
  - Are there any obstacles?
    - Allow members to help each other after meeting.

- It's not a status meeting. The status meeting goal is to report what was done to the manager, only. Besides this goal, Daily Scrum also provides:
  - Self-organization: each member must plan their next steps and fulfill their accountability.
  - Maximize transparency because it enables frequent inspection and adaptation. This is important to deal with the complexity and unpredictability that exists in software development.
  - Remember the team about the Sprint goals and values to be delivered.
  - Collaboration. Once someone has been blocked, a team member can help to solve the problem.

## Questions

- Can Daily Scrum be done asynchronously?
