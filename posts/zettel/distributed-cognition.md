## Notes

- It's a process of getting things out of your head and into objective, and reviewable format.

- It's an **extended mind** or a **second brain**.

- Few people can hold their focus on a topic for more than a couple of minutes only relying on their minds.

  - You need tools and some objective structure to help. For instance, if we have a pen and paper, then we can stay focused for hours.

- The mind works this way:

  1. It will give you some ideas as you feel you can effectively use them.
  1. If you're not collecting it in a trusted way, it won't give you more.
  1. If you're recording them, even for later evaluation, it'll give you more ideas.

- It helps you organize your thoughts.
  - Natural and complex connections may emerge.
