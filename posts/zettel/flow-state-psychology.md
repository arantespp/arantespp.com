## Notes

- Is a mental state in which a person is performing an activity:
  - fully immersed;
  - high focus;
  - full involvement and enjoyment.
- It's the most efficient state when doing a task.
- Lose awareness of all other things.
- The person may lose the sense of time.
- Named by [Mihály Csíkszentmihályi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi) in 1975.
- Three conditions have to be met to achieve a flow state:
  1. Clear goals and progress.
  1. Clear and immediate feedback.
  1. The task difficult must match the person's skill level.
     - If task difficult < person skill: boredom.
     - If task difficult = person skill: **flow**.
     - If task difficult > person skill: anxiety.
- According to [Mihály Csíkszentmihályi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi), we can process about 110 bits of information per second.
  - Person in flow state decided to use all these bits on the task.
  - There is no more attention to be allocated.
