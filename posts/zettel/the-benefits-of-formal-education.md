## Notes

- From the book [The Unfair Advantage](/the-unfair-advantage), having a good education is a vast Unfair Advantage.

- Formal education happens at school or university, while informal education is the education you undertake yourself of your choice.

- Knowledge, network, and signaling are the three main benefits of a good education.

### Knowledge

- It's the purpose of education what you learn in school, which includes literacy, mathematics, and facts - and then more profound and more specialized at university.

### Network

- When you go to university, you'll meet others who have also managed to gain entry into that university who are intelligent and driven.

### Signaling

- It's the same as credentialing, which shows others that you have the skills and intelligence for specific jobs.

- It also means status if you to an elite university. It gives you immediate credibility.
