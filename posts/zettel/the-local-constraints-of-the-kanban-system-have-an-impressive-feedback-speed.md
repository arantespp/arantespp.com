## Notes

Because of the [pull principle](/zettel/kanban-pull-principle), the upstream processes can't send work to the next stage if a blockage occurs anywhere. Also, they can't start new work if all steps have their [WIP](/zettel/work-in-process-wip) limit. So this situation signals to the team that there's some problem at some stage quickly.
