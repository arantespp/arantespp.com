Ok, this is my most challenging text. I've been delayed in starting to write it because I'll need to have a lot of self-awareness.

This text will be an endless text. I should edit it often.

What is the difference between principles and values?

## Principles

### Integrity

I "walk my talk." Every word I say I do, I'm honest to them and apply to every aspect of my life.

## Values

My three greatest values are power, light, and humor.

### Power

Power is the most important value for me. I mean by power as the person of total and contagious energy. [Sam Altman defined](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful) this kind of power as a "force of nature" person. It means that the person has a powerful character, high energy, unstoppable, and is unforgettable.

### Light

For me, the definition of light is a person who is light to others. In John 8:12, Jesus states, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life." I like this definition, and it touches me so profoundly. A driver question to this value is, "How can I impact as many lives as possible in a positive way?" I bring this question with me.

This value makes me play only non-zero-sum games. Every person I meet, I always try to aggregate value to them.

### Humor

Humor is my third most important value. A person that has a high degree of humor is a person that can control their emotions so well and has their spiritual body significantly evolved. They're the kind of people who can keep calm and spread it to others in a chaotic environment.

## Goals

Some goals I want to achieve in the long term.

### Excel in Energy Management

We can divide the types of energy into four quadrants. One axis refers to the intensity of the energy, high or low. The other axis to the quality of the energy, positive or negative.

I have had this goal since I read The Power of Full Engagement. I want with this goal to create the skill to see if I'm in a negative state and change to a positive condition immediately, probably low positive. Also, I want to build the ability to navigate between low positive and high positive whenever I want.

Low positive has an essential role in this goal. If I can master it, I can use it to diminish negative energies to a state of relaxation, and I can use it to recharge the batteries of high positive.

### Create a Strong Network

### Master in a Field

I chose entrepreneurship as my profession because it is about building something from scratch and impacting the world.
