Ok, this is my most challenging text. I've been delayed in starting to write it because I'll need to have a lot of self-awareness.

What is the difference between principles and values?

My three greatest values are power, light, and humor.

### Power

Power is the most important value for me. I mean by power as the person of total and contagious energy. [Sam Altman defined](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful) this kind of power as a "force of nature" person. It means that the person has a powerful character, high energy, unstoppable, and is unforgettable.

### Light

For me, the definition of light is a person who is light to others. In John 8:12, Jesus states, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life." I like this definition, and it touches me so profoundly. A driver question to this value is, "How can I impact as many lives as possible in a positive way?" I bring this question with me.

This value makes me play only non-zero-sum games. Every person I meet, I always try to aggregate value to them.

### Humor

Humor is my third most important value. A person that has a high degree of humor is a person that can control their emotions so well and has their spiritual body significantly evolved. They're the kind of people that in a chaotic environment, them can keep calm and spread it to others.
