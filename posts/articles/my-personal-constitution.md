Ok, this is my most challenging text. I've been delayed in starting to write it because I'll need to have a lot of self-awareness.

This text will be an endless text. I should edit it often.

What is the difference between principles and values?

## Principles

Principles are like physics law or rules that govern our lives. Wherever actions we choose to do, consequences will happen accordingly with some principles. For example, the consequences of being upright or not with our words will take place accordingly with the [integrity](###integrity) principle, whether we like it or not.

Unlike [values](##values), we can't choose which principles will work for us. We can choose the ones that we identify most, that is the list of principles below. They're the ones I identify most with and are a guideline to my conduct on daily basis. They're also the core of my principle-centered paradigm, whose idea I took from the book [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](/t7hhep).

### Integrity

I "walk my talk." Every word I say I do, I'm honest to them and apply to every aspect of my life.

### Authenticity

Basically, it means that I'll be the true version of myself in every circumstance. The opposite happens when we don't have strong self-esteem and security and the people around us influence our behaviors, whether we want it or not. For example, [vulnerability](###vulnerability) is a principle that makes me express my emotions openly. Suppose I'm not secure with myself and I'm with a group that mocks people who express their emotions. If the group influences me, I won't be vulnerable, then I won't be authentic.

### Win-Win Relationships

I always go to win-win decisions.

### Abundance

There is wealth for everyone in this world.

### Serendipity

### Vulnerability

### Compounding

I believe that small frequent actions are more effective than big infrequent actions. Also, small actions in the long-run compounds. I first saw this principle in the book [The Psychology of Money](/tpom), which argues that the best strategy for investing is using the time in your favor and letting the small investments compound. Humans don't have the perception of compounding because exponential thinking isn't so intuitive as linear thinking.

I use this principle in all parts of my life, not just for money. I use it for working out, in which a few exercises every day will bring more results than an intense and irregular workout.

## Values

My three greatest values are power, light, and humor.

### Power

Power is the most important value for me. I mean by power as the person of total and contagious energy. [Sam Altman defined](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful) this kind of power as a "force of nature" person. It means that the person has a powerful character, high energy, is unstoppable, and is unforgettable.

### Light

For me, the definition of light is a person who is light to others. In John 8:12, Jesus states, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life." I like this definition, and it touches me so profoundly. A driver question to this value is, "How can I impact as many lives as possible in a positive way?" I bring this question with me.

This value makes me play only non-zero-sum games. Every person I meet, I always try to aggregate value to them.

### Humor

Humor is my third most important value. A person that has a high degree of humor is a person that can control their emotions so well and has their spiritual body significantly evolved. They're the kind of people who can keep calm and spread it to others in a chaotic environment.

### Freedom

Freedom of time. Freedom to do whatever I want to do, who I want to be, where I want to be.

## Goals

Some goals I want to achieve in the long term.

### Excel in Energy Management

We can divide the types of energy into four quadrants. One axis refers to the intensity of the energy, high or low. The other axis to the quality of the energy, positive or negative.

I have had this goal since I read The Power of Full Engagement. I want with this goal to create the skill to see if I'm in a negative state and change to a positive condition immediately, probably low positive. Also, I want to build the ability to navigate between low positive and high positive whenever I want.

Low positive has an essential role in this goal. If I can master it, I can use it to diminish negative energies to a state of relaxation, and I can use it to recharge the batteries of high positive.

### Create a Strong Network

I want to help as many people as possible with the win-win mentality and light value.

### Master in a Field

I chose entrepreneurship as my profession because it is about building something from scratch and impacting the world.

## Roles

My most important roles.

### Family Member

I want to listen and support my relatives whenever they need me.
