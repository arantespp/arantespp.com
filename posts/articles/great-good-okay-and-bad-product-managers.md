I wrote this article as an exercise to understand the characteristics of the role of a Product Manager. This idea came after reading a [Shreyas Doshi](https://twitter.com/shreyas) thread in which he explained some traits of Good and Great Product Managers.

While reading, I asked myself, "Great thread explaining about the Great and the Good Product Managers, but what about the Bad and Okay ones? If I know the characteristics of them, then I know what should and shouldn't do."

## Structure of this article

For each tweet of the original thread, I created a section with the characteristics of each PM. The **Good** and **Great** is the original one, which I copied from the tweet. As part of my exercise, I tried to explain each topic briefly and fill in the **Bad** and **Okay** PMs attributes.

- **Bad**:
- **Okay**:
- **Good**:
- **Great**:

### 1/ Deliver

How do PMs deliver products and results to their customers?

- **Bad**: Bad PMs don't deliver products and results.
- **Okay**: Okay PMs deliver products and results, sometimes with quality.
- **Good**: _"Good PMs consistently deliver quality products and results."_
- **Great**: _"Great PMs consistently and singularly improve the company's trajectory through the products they work on."_

### 2/ Metrics

How do PMs use metrics and data to make product decisions?

- **Bad**: Bad PMs don't use metrics to make product decisions.
- **Okay**: Okay PMs use wrong metrics to make product decisions.
- **Good**: _"Good PMs make metrics-driven product decisions."_
- **Great**: _"Great PMs make metrics-informed product decisions. Great PMs are masters of the art of blending quantitative and qualitative inputs, as warranted by each individual situation."_

### 3/ Product Domain

How much do PMs know the domain of their products?

- **Bad**: Bad PMs don't do product research and use only their intuition.
- **Okay**: Okay PMs do basic research about the domain in their product operates.
- **Good**: _"Good PMs extensively research the domain in which their product operates."_
- **Great**: _"Great PMs become the worldwide experts in that domain. When new to a domain, great PMs bootstrap this process by seeking the counsel of existing worldwide experts."_

### 4/ User Research

How do PMs use market research to develop their products?

- **Bad**: Bad PMs don't do market research at all.
- **Okay**: Okay PMs do acceptable user research and use it to focus more on shipping new features than fixing UI issues.
- **Good**: _"Good PMs are proactive about doing user research to identify & fix UI issues in their product."_
- **Great**: _"Great PMs have a broader view of the value of user research. Great PMs are diligent about using a variety of user research methods to inform what product to build in the first place."_
