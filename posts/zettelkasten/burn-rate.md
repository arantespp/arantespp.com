## Notes

- Burn rate is the rate at which a [startup](/z/startup) spends money in its bank account.

- It's calculated by startup total expenses minus income.

- It's a good metric for early-stage startups when using (burning) investors' money.

- It tells how long the startup can keep its operations before needing more capital.
