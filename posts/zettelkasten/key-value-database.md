## Notes

- Key-value database, or key-value store, is a data storage paradigm that allows you to store opaque data collection with an associated key.

  - You restore the records by their keys.

- Each key uniquely identifies a record.

- Each collection may have different fields.

- It works differently from relational databases (RDB) because RDBs predefine the data structure in the database as a series of tables containing well-defined data types.

- It offers flexibility because you can store any object structure.

- It uses less memory to store the same database compared with RDB.

- Examples of key-value databases:
  - [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).
  - [Redis](https://redis.io/).
