## Notes

- When faced with a problem, people tend to prefer solutions that add new elements rather than removing elements, even if removing is the more efficient solution.

- It can be considered as a [system mental model](/zettelkasten/system-mental-models) because it explains how our mind works.

- Experiments show that people tend to consider subtracting more if cues are given or if they had more time and opportunities to analyze the problem.

  - Subtractive solutions take more effort to find.

- Other reasons for this effect.

  - People tend to continue investing in things for which time, money or effort has already been spent, the sunk cost bias.

  - Greater likelihood that additive solutions will be appreciated.
