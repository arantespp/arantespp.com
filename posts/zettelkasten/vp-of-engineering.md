## Notes

- VP of Engineering role faces inward. They're responsible for building the engineering team and establishing the engineering culture and operations.

- They help the team works efficiently and then almost disappear. As a result, developers on the team collaborate well, mentor each other, and communicate effectively.

  - VP of Engineering constantly monitors the team's progress, culture, and tone of communications.

- The best VPs of Engineering know both functional and dysfunctional teams.

  - They know the patterns and anti-patterns for effective development workflows.

- They work with the heads of product and product managers to ensure that there's a good product discovery process. They provide that engineers reviewed product deliverables before implementation hand-offs.

- They are responsible for managing the annual bottom-up budget for the engineering department.

- A VP of Engineering must have technical and management skills.

- _"If the CTO knows the destination, the VP of Engineering is identifying the route to get there."_ [Reference.](https://medium.com/connect-the-dots/what-does-a-vp-of-engineering-do-75da2086f74d)

- They report to CEO directly.
