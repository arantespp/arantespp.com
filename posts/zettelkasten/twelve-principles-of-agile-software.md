## Notes

1. _Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software._

2. _Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage._

3. _Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale._

4. _Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project._

5. _Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done._

6. _The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation._

7. _Working software is the primary measure of progress._

8. _Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely._

9. _Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility._

10. _Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential._

11. _The best architectures, requirements, and design emerge from self-organizing teams._

12. _At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly._
