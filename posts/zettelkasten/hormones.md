## Notes

- Hormones are your body's chemical messengers. They're any member of a class of signaling molecules that regulates physiology and behavior.

- They're substances that travel in your bloodstream to tissues or organs.

- A tiny amount of hormones is capable of causing significant changes in cells or even your whole body.

- Endocrine glands make hormones. The major endocrine glands are the pituitary, pineal, thymus, thyroid, adrenal, pancreas, and [gonads](/zettelkasten/gonads).

- They work slowly, over time, and affect many different processes, including:
  - growth and development;
  - [metabolism](/zettelkasten/metabolism);
  - sexual function;
  - reproduction;
  - mood swings;
  - activation of inhibition of the [immune system](/zettelkaste/immune-system);
  - wake-sleep cycle and other [circadian rhythms](/zettelkasten/circadian-rhythms).
