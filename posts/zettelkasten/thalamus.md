## Notes

- It has several functions, such as relaying sensory signals, including motor signals to the cerebral cortex and regulating consciousness, sleep, and alertness.

- It acts as a relay station or hub. Every sensory system, except the olfactory, includes a thalamic nucleus that receives signals and sends them to the associated cortical area.

- The thalamus plays a significant role in regulating arousal, the level of awareness, and activity.
  - Damage to the thalamus can lead to a permanent coma.
