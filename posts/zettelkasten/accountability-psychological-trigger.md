## Notes

- You need accountability to build up credibility. So you have to do things under your name as much as possible, with risky.

- Accountability is a double-edge: it allows you to take credit when things go well and bear the brunt of failure.

- Influencers have much social capital because they risky their image and export themselves.

- People that stamp their names on things are confident.

- Society rewards people with accountability because they take the risk of failure and humiliation. You take the risk of loss under your name. **People who do this have a lot of power**.
