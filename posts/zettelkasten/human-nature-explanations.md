## Notes

The book [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](/b/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people) says three social maps explain human nature. These three theories are widely accepted, independent or in combination, to explain the nature of man.

1. **Genetic determinism**: it says that you're who you're because of your DNA.

1. **Psych determinism**: it says that your parents did it to you. Your upbringing and childhood experience essentially laid out your tendencies and character structure.

1. **Environmental determinism**: it says that your boss, spouse, economic or political situation, national policies are doing it to you. Someone or something in your environment is responsible for your situation.
