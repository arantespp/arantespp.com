## Notes

- Product management is the intersection between business, [user experience](/z/user-experience), and technology.

- It's about bringing together the three functions above, a lot of market research, creativity, vision, and more to build value for the customers and the business.

- It also contains a roadmap of interactive and incremental development to help the business reach the vision.
