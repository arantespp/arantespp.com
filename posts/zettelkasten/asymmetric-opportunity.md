## Notes

- An asymmetric opportunity is one in which the upside is much more significant than the downside.

- Examples of asymmetric opportunities:

  - **The stock market** because it has unlimited upside potential.
  - **Creating content** because they are scalable products. People can consume them infinitely without any extra effort from you.

- Cryptocurrencies are asymmetric opportunities.
