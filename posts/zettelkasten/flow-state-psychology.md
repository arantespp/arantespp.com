  - full involvement and enjoyment.

- Three conditions ahve to be met to achieve a flow state:
  1. Clear goals and progress.
  1. Clear and immediate feedback.
  1. The task difficult must match the person skill level.
     - If task difficult < person skill: boredom.
     - If task difficult = person skill: **flow**.
     - If task difficult > person skill: anxiety.
- According to [Mihály Csíkszentmihályi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi), we can process about 110 bits of information per second.
  - Person in flow state decided to use all these bits on the task.
