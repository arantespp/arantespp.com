## Notes

- This framework helps you assign and do work that must be done.

- It's a [decision mental model](/zettelkasten/decision-mental-models) because it helps you assign and do tasks.

- This framework starts with the work to be done. It assumes that you've already filtered and selected the work that you should pay attention to.

- It has 4 quadrants that you classify the work to be done:

  1. **Focus deeply yourself**.

     - Only you can do the work.
     - The work has high leverage.

  2. **Delegate to most suitable person**.

     - Various folks can do the work (the most suitable ones).
     - The work has high leverage.

  3. **Set up the essential foundation**.

     - Only you can set up the foundation.
     - Work here has low to medium leverage.

  4. **Delegate and forget**.

     - Many people can do the work.
     - The work has low to medium leverage.

- Many leaders tend to work in each of the 4 quadrants, especially 1, 2, and 3, which leads to some significant problems.

  - Leaders are overwhelmed.
  - They're unavailable to their team.
  - The team doesn't get good coaching because the leaders are overwhelmed.
  - Good folks aren't stretched because the leaders aren't paying attention.
  - Important work doesn't get done.
  - Eventually, people burn out.

- This framework allows you and your team to have the highest leverage work and best coaching.

- As this framework relies on delegations, your manager needs to understand what and why you're doing.
