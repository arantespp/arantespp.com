## Notes

- It was coined by Marc Andreesen in the post [Part 4: The only thing that matters](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html).

  - _"Product/market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market."_

- Every company must find its PMF before scaling or sniffing around for venture money.

- The value hypothesis, or PMF, is an assumption that brings together:

  - **company**: what is the product or service;
  - **market**: which are the audience or customers that are likely to care about your product;
  - **business model**: how the product will be offered to the customers buy it.

- You can find the PMF by:

  - changing your customers (market pivot);
  - changing your product.

- Finding the PMF is not a discrete process. It requires many iterations and consistency.

- _You can always feel when PMF is happening_.

  - You're selling your products just as fast as you can make it.
  - Customers are paying for your product.
  - You're hiring sales and customer support staff.

- _You can always feel when PMF isn't happening_.
  - Your cycle sales are too long.
  - Customers aren't getting value out of the product.
  - A lot of deals never close.
  - The reviews are negative or neutral.

## Questions

- How do you find your PMF?

- Is there a universal process that fits to any startup looking for its PMF?
