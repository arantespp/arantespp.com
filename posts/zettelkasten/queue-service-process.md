## Notes

- The queue service process is the process in which the server accomplishes the work.

  - For example, the probability that a server accomplishes the work in a given time.

- When the queue is empty, the service process doesn't do anything.

- You can model it as a [Markov process](/zettelkasten/markov-process).
