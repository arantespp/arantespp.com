## Notes

- Very few successful startups have co-CEOs or shared leadership. Two things happen:

  1. Every decision becomes excruciatingly difficult.
  2. Investors won't invest when they see redundant roles in the company.

- Organizations with co-CEOs frequently fail.

- The fact the team can't agree on a leader indicates the lack of ability to make difficult decisions.
