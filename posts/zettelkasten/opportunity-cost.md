## Notes

- Opportunity cost is the loss of the benefit of the best foregone option that you could have chosen.

  - You have choices A, B, and C with $B_a = 100$, $B_b = 80$, and $B_c = 50$ as their respective benefit. Considering you've chosen the best option, A, your opportunity cost in this scenario is $80$ because it's the benefit of the best foregone option.

- It's a microeconomic theory.

- It's a [decision mental model](/zettelkasten/decision-mental-models) because it helps you decide to choose among options.

- It's not easy to calculate the exact cost of all options because some are unseen because of the implicit costs.

  - Implicit costs: these costs are hidden to the naked eye and aren't made known. They're not a direct cost to you. For instance, if you have a vacation home, the implicit cost is the rental income you could have generated if you leased it.
    - Implicit costs have significant potential. If you choose to start a company instead of earning a known salary, you can make much more than the salary.
  - Explicit costs: they're direct costs of an action, executed either through a cash transaction or a physical transfer of resources.
