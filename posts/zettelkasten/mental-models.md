## Notes

- Mental models are frameworks, worldviews, representations, or explanations of how something works. They're how we understand the world.

- They shape the connections we create among systems.

- They're thinking tools that we use to solve problems and make decisions.

- They help us overcome the [hyperbolic discounting](/zettelkasten/hyperbolic-discounting) problem.

- Without mental models, you rely on your current emotions or instincts.

- They're imperfect but useful.

- The bigger your mental model toolbox, the more likely you're to have the right models to see reality.

  - If you look at the problem individually, you've got a blind spot.

- For instance, imagine that there is a party. We can see it in these ways:
  - Business: the profit by selling invitations or drinks.
  - Psychology: the music and the mood it creates on the participants.
  - Anthropology: the human interactions.
