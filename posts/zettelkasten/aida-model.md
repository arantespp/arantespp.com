## Notes

- AIDA model helps understanding better the process or steps that the consumer goes through before purchasing a product.
- E. St. Elmo Lewis developed it in 1898.
- AIDA stands for **Attention**, **Interest**, **Desire**, and **Action**.
  - **Attention**: attract consumer attention via advertising materials. _Example: consumer watches a YouTube ad._
  - **Interest**: the product should arouse consumer interests. _For example, the website presents more information about the product to the consumer._
  - **Desire**: the seller should create a desire in the consumer to own the product. _For example, the seller provides examples and benefits that the product will bring to the consumer._
  - **Action**: the consumer must take action, whether buying or not. _For example, in e-commerce, this is the shopping cart process that must be easiest as possible._
- Nowadays, this model is not complete because:
  - It doesn't consider the emotion associated with a selling process, which is an elementary consideration.
  - It doesn't include target social-demographic types of users.
  - The process doesn't need to be linear as proposed by this method.
