# startup-accelerator

## Notes

* Also known as **seed accelerator**.
* It's fixed-term and cohort-based programs that include mentorship and educational components for startups.
* At the end of the program, a public pitch event or a demo day occurs.
  * The accelerated startups present their business to investors.
* It generally takes no equity and rarely provides funding.
* The focus of startup accelerators is on small teams, not on individual founders.
  * They consider that one person isn't enough to handle all the work associated with a startup.
