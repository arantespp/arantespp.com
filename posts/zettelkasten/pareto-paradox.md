## Notes

- Because of the [Pareto Principle](/zettelkasten/pareto-principle), we tend to overmanage the 20% high payoff causes and undermanage the remaining 80%. This management leads to what we might call **Pareto Paradox**.

- **Pareto Paradox** states that there are usually more opportunities in the undermanaged 80% than the overmanaged 20%.

- It's a [decision mental model](/zettelkasten/decision-mental-models) because it helps you decide how to manage the tasks of your job to get more potential opportunities.
