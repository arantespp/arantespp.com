## Notes

- It's an abstract role because the product development field is abstract.

- The core tasks of a PM are:

  - discover the business' core;
  - define the personas and their pain and how to solve it;
  - prioritize what to build, ideally choosing what generates more value faster with fewer resources;
  - keep the team aware of the product status;
  - define the right metrics for the product.

- PMs have a closer relationship with other departments: engineering, marketing, design, finances.
