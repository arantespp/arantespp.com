## Notes

- Also known as **venture building**, **startup factory**, **startup foundry**, or **venture studio**.

- It's an organization that creates startups following a repetitive process. It acts as a co-founder to startups.

  - Besides providing funding for early-stage startups (as a VC do), Studios will also assign members of their own team to help the original founding team build the startup.

    - Because of this, Studios take more equity than VCs.

- The products of Startup Studios are startups.

- Some Studios:

  - [Pioneer Square Labs](https://www.psl.com/).
  - [Atomic](https://atomic.vc/).
  - [Rocket Internet](https://www.rocket-internet.com/).

- **A Studio must have its thesis to get focus on**.

  - A Studio thesis is principles to be followed in every decision making.
  - Examples of thesis:
    - Improving healthcare.
    - Improving the ways of payments.
    - Building AI-powered products.
  - Without a thesis, Studios may become overwhelmed and lose cost-saving efficiencies.
    - This makes Studios valuable.

- Studios make money through startup exits.
