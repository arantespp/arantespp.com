## Notes

- People consider most the opinion of ones they believe to be better at something, whether because of hierarchy or because the person truly knows about the subject, as a doctor.

  - People tend to accept the opinion of authorities.

- Marketing uses this psychological trigger to sell more because an authority gives more credibility to the product.

- You can create authority by offering helpful material for free constantly. It takes time, but it can bring significant results.
