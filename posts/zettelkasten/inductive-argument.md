## Notes

- An inductive argument is an argument where the author intends to show that if all premises are true, then its conclusion is not sure to be true, but instead, it's probably or likely true.

- Inductive arguments aim to show good reasons to accept the conclusion despite the lack of complete certainty.

- Also known as inductive reasoning.

- Examples:
  - Researches interviewed 1000 people in a city, and 80% said that they drink coffee. Therefore, it's probable that 80% of the city population drinks coffee.
  - João doesn't take care of his health. Therefore, it's likely that he'll have a health problem in the future.
