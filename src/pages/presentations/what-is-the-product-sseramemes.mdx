# Segmentation

## Who are the "customers"?

- At first, we've decided to focus on Brazilian developers -> only create memes in Portuguese.
- Our most popular meme, [Frontend is my passion](https://twitter.com/sseramemes/status/1550612597875130369), became global -> **What about creating memes in English?**

_Product development is dynamic._

# Distribution Channel

## How do we reach the "customers"?

[**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/sseramemes) is our main channel, but sometimes we get some memes on others websites, like Reddit, Instagram, or LinkedIn, which create [network effects](/zettel/network-effects).
